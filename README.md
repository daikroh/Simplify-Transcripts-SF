## Installation
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to install the dependencies.

Create the virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv demo
```

And activate it:
```
source demo/bin/activate
```

To deactivate it:
```
deactivate
```

We'll use pip3 to install the packages for Python. If your system doesn't have pip3 installed, you can run the following in bash:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

With the virtual environment set up, we can install django
```
pip3 install django
```
