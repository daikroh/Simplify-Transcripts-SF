(0:06:20) SPEAKER_02: Thank you, Madam Clerk.
(0:06:22) SPEAKER_02: Colleagues, today I have a resolution and an in memoriam.
(0:06:29) SPEAKER_02: The resolution is urging the city to establish a small business relief fund for merchants who will be affected by the Islayas Creek Bridge replacement project along the Third Street Bayview corridor.
(0:06:41) SPEAKER_02: Construction will begin as early as January 2027 and will last for about three years and will result in the closure of 3rd Street between Moran Street and Cargo Way, cutting off direct access for residents, workers and customers.
(0:06:58) SPEAKER_02: This poses a serious risk to the neighborhoods, small businesses, many of which are legacy, immigrant-owned, and black and brown-owned establishments that already face systemic barriers to recovery and growth.
(0:07:12) SPEAKER_02: The bridge project is necessary for public safety and climate resilience, but the city must not ignore the economic harm that could result without proper safeguards in place.
(0:07:24) SPEAKER_02: Small businesses along their 3rd Street corridor are already sounding the alarm that this project could devastate their customer base and make it impossible to stay afloat.
(0:07:35) SPEAKER_02: The city has a responsibility to protect these merchants and ensure they are not left behind, just like how we created relief funds for merchants doing other projects or during the pandemic.
(0:07:48) SPEAKER_02: A creation of a small business relief fund dedicated to those impacted by this project should include grants, rent support, marketing help, and targeted outreach.
(0:07:59) SPEAKER_02: If we can fund and build climate resilient infrastructure, we can also fund resilience for our local economies and working class neighborhoods.
(0:08:09) SPEAKER_02: I also have an in memoriam.
(0:08:13) SPEAKER_02: It is with a heavy heart that I joined the Port of San Francisco and our entire city in the morning of the sudden death of Byron Rhett.
(0:08:25) SPEAKER_02: Byron was a dedicated public servant
(0:08:28) SPEAKER_02: whose decades of leadership helped shape the San Francisco we know today.
(0:08:33) SPEAKER_02: From his early years at the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, where he led critical revitalization efforts in Bayview Hunters Point, to his transformative work at the Port of San Francisco, Byron brought vision, compassion, and purpose to everything he touched.
(0:08:52) SPEAKER_02: as Planning and Development Director, and later as Chief Operating Officer, he was the quiet force behind some of the city's most iconic projects, from the revitalization of Pier 1, to the creation of Crane Cove Park, and the innovation at Mission Rock and Pier 70.
(0:09:10) SPEAKER_02: But Byron was more than a leader.
(0:09:12) SPEAKER_02: He was a mentor, an advocate, and a builder of community.
(0:09:17) SPEAKER_02: He believed deeply in equity, particularly in uplifting the Bayview, and he led with most integrity and heart.
(0:09:26) SPEAKER_02: His work lives on, not only in the places he's helped create, but in the values and spirit he instilled in those around him.
(0:09:35) SPEAKER_02: San Francisco is better because of Byron Red.
(0:09:38) SPEAKER_02: I am grateful for his lifelong commitment to our city, and I extend my deepest condolences to his wife Andrea and their sons, Justin and Zane.
(0:09:49) SPEAKER_02: May his memory continue to guide us as we build a more inclusive and connected San Francisco.
(0:09:56) SPEAKER_02: The rest I submit.
(0:09:57) SPEAKER_05: Thank you, Supervisor Walton.
(0:09:59) SPEAKER_05: Supervisor Chan.
(0:10:01) SPEAKER_04: Thank you, Madam Clerk.
(0:10:03) SPEAKER_04: Colleagues, first, I'm introducing a resolution in support of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technician, Local 51, who represents KQED union workers and their efforts to demand KQED leadership to reinvest in local television programming, stop outsourcing production work,
(0:10:24) SPEAKER_04: support valuable unionized jobs and to ensure that our public media outlets reflect the needs of our local communities in the Bay Area.
(0:10:34) SPEAKER_04: KQED had already eliminated all of their local news programming in 2023 and has continued to outsource production work
(0:10:43) SPEAKER_04: to non-unionized facilities.
(0:10:45) SPEAKER_04: KQED's retreat from local television production is not only a threat to KQED employees, but also sets a dangerous presence for union laborers and their shared values with the communities that they serve.
(0:11:04) SPEAKER_04: Also colleagues I today I'm introducing a resolution putting San Francisco on the record to oppose state Senate bill 79 unless amended affordable housing developers and various tenants group to attempt to secure
(0:11:22) SPEAKER_04: amendments from the bill's chief sponsor, Senator Scott Wiener.
(0:11:27) SPEAKER_04: And yet they have not been successful.
(0:11:32) SPEAKER_04: So as their representative and local elected policymaker, we must stand up and intervene when bad state policy is being rushed through.
(0:11:43) SPEAKER_04: we must have these discussion in public, not behind closed door.
(0:11:49) SPEAKER_04: SB 79 will undo years of thoughtful community planning and put San Francisco's tenants and small businesses at risk of displacement without any protections, particularly as we anticipate additional amendments that would also incentivize the demolition of rent control units.
(0:12:11) SPEAKER_04: SB 79's predecessor, SB 50, was rejected years ago, five years ago, by this board supervisors in this chamber because of its overreach and its potential threats to low income and communities of color in vulnerable transit accessible neighborhoods across cities in California.
(0:12:35) SPEAKER_04: Now I am concerned that SB 79 is being fast tracked while San Francisco is undertaking its own local citywide rezoning up zoning that seeks to be compliance with the California Department of Housing and Community Development's approved housing element.
(0:12:54) SPEAKER_04: that we all already adopted unanimously.
(0:12:58) SPEAKER_04: SB 79 would completely override the work of that housing element to create protections for priority equity geographies, particularly in our neighbourhood commercial corridors where small businesses are already struggling with rent and costs of doing business increase.
(0:13:17) SPEAKER_04: We cannot buy blinded trust that tenants and small business will somehow magically be protected from displacement.
(0:13:26) SPEAKER_04: Neighborhoods like the Richmond will be most at risk of being hollowed out as lots are merged, rents are increased and buildings are empty out to make them more attractive to real estate speculators.
(0:13:44) SPEAKER_04: places and in our neighborhoods have no protection from any of these speculative behaviors.
(0:13:51) SPEAKER_04: There are also no guarantee that any housing, especially affordable housing, will even be built anytime soon.
(0:13:59) SPEAKER_04: Somehow our own local administration will really have to recognize that ultimately this is not a housing bill.
(0:14:08) SPEAKER_04: It is a deregulation and developer giveaway bill.
(0:14:14) SPEAKER_04: It is not about actually building housing.
(0:14:16) SPEAKER_04: It is about making the land attractive enough for speculator and investors to buy up, to increase the profits at the front end, and land is always more attractive without tenants.
(0:14:31) SPEAKER_04: And in this case, for us, the people of San Francisco.
(0:14:35) SPEAKER_04: Finally, the biggest problem with this bill, SB 79, is the lack of funding for affordability.
(0:14:41) SPEAKER_04: Governor Gavin Newsom put out a budget with no funding for housing and homelessness, only punitive mandates.
(0:14:51) SPEAKER_04: This is madness, and San Francisco cannot continue to shoulder the entire responsibility for funding housing infrastructure and free market.
(0:15:00) SPEAKER_04: And we can all know, have learned from years of history in San Francisco, when we try to build affordable housing, that free market has never and will never build us enough affordable housing for San Franciscans.
(0:15:14) SPEAKER_04: And the rest I submit.
(0:15:16) SPEAKER_04: Thank you.
(0:15:16) SPEAKER_05: Thank you, Supervisor Chen.

(0:15:28) SPEAKER_08: Thank you, Madam Clerk.
(0:15:29) SPEAKER_08: Colleagues with appreciation to Supervisor Melgar and her staff for their work on this, particularly Mike Farrah, I am today introducing a resolution that urges Blue Shield of California and the University of California Health System to resolve their dispute regarding reimbursement for medical services and treatment.
(0:15:49) SPEAKER_08: This ongoing contract dispute was poised to disrupt healthcare access for many thousands of San Franciscans, including thousands of our city workers and retirees, in a matter of just a few days.
(0:16:01) SPEAKER_08: Thankfully, we received word yesterday that the parties extended their negotiating deadline for 30 days to August 9th and that they remain in negotiations.
(0:16:11) SPEAKER_08: Still, a large segment of our city's workforce and retirees remain uncertain about the promise of access to UCSF health physicians and services that they relied upon when they chose Blue Shield during open enrollment.
(0:16:25) SPEAKER_08: For Blue Shield to now potentially eliminate these health care options in the middle of a plan year is, in my view, unfair, and I want to express my appreciation to city attorney David Chu and his office for exploring the city's legal options in this matter.
(0:16:39) SPEAKER_08: I again want to thank Supervisor Melgar who like me represents much of UCSF's footprint in San Francisco for cosponsoring this resolution.
(0:16:47) SPEAKER_08: It is a relatively straightforward expression of our collective hope as a board of supervisors that we urge UCSF Health and Blue Shield to resolve their dispute by renewing their contract and thereby preserving their members ability to access the crucial health care services they signed up for or
(0:17:05) SPEAKER_08: In the event that no long-term solution between Blue Shield and UCSF is possible, urging the parties to at least commit to preserve existing services for the remainder of the planned year and to provide certainty for future benefits for the 2026 plan year in time for open enrollment this fall.
(0:17:26) SPEAKER_08: As your appointee to the San Francisco Health Services Board, I am working with HSS Director Ray Guyan and his team as well as City Attorney Chu and his team to monitor this situation.
(0:17:37) SPEAKER_08: I know all of us have been hearing from our constituents as well as from our city workers and retirees on this matter for the certainty of health benefits for all of them and their families.
(0:17:47) SPEAKER_08: I hope I can have your support on this resolution as well and the rest I submit.
(0:17:51) SPEAKER_05: Thank you, Supervisor Dorsey, Supervisor Angardio.
(0:17:55) SPEAKER_05: Submit, thank you, Supervisor Fielder.
(0:17:59) SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Madam Clerk.
(0:18:00) SPEAKER_01: Colleagues, I'm introducing a resolution today to designate July 12th as Toucan Day in honor of the fifth anniversary of the District Nine Block Party that celebrates the life and legacy of Sean Montrose, as it has every year since 2020.
(0:18:17) SPEAKER_01: Sean Montrose had a bright, beautiful, and limitless life ahead of him.
(0:18:23) SPEAKER_01: He was ambitious, loved by his community, was constantly looking for ways to uplift youth and those around him, and was deeply proud of his roots.
(0:18:33) SPEAKER_01: As you know, his life was taken from him far too soon by a Vallejo police officer in 2020.
(0:18:39) SPEAKER_01: but his memory and legacy live on in the community that continues to organize against police brutality, and his powerful sisters who continue to fight for justice, not only for their family, but others impacted by police brutality, and in the structures, art, and programs that have been created in his memory, including the Sean Montrose Knowledge Up Community Library that provides bilingual books about social justice.
(0:19:07) SPEAKER_01: a mural in his honor at 24th and South of Venice, and the street named San Montrose Boulevard next to Holly Park, where he grew up.
(0:19:15) SPEAKER_01: Toucandé is named after Sean's childhood nickname.
(0:19:19) SPEAKER_01: It is a block party full of art, music, activities, and conversation about the issues Sean cared about.
(0:19:27) SPEAKER_01: And above all else, it is a day for community healing.
(0:19:31) SPEAKER_01: Sean was a young leader who worked on so many issues to make this a better world for young people.
(0:19:36) SPEAKER_01: It is with that spirit that this resolution honors him and his family by designating this special day on its fifth anniversary as Toucan Day in San Francisco.
(0:19:48) SPEAKER_01: I want to thank early co-sponsors, supervisors Chen, Melgarn Walton, and I especially want to thank Michelle and Ashley Montrose for their tireless work to honor their brother and build community around his bright light.
(0:20:02) SPEAKER_01: The rest I submit.
(0:20:03) SPEAKER_05: Thank you, supervisor Fielder, supervisor Mahmood.
(0:20:12) SPEAKER_06: Colleagues today, I am introducing the shared housing reform act, an ordinance that is meant to modernize the city's outdated definition of family in the planning code to expand access to shared housing and bring San Francisco into compliance with state housing regulations.
(0:20:31) SPEAKER_06: San Francisco is a city of renters and in our city's present housing affordability crisis, we must do all that we can to support household shared between unrelated roommates.
(0:20:41) SPEAKER_06: These homes are a first step to independence and a first step to a life in San Francisco for so many.
(0:20:48) SPEAKER_06: But under current law, many of these households may be at risk of enforcement action from the planning department for not fitting under an outdated definition of family.
(0:20:58) SPEAKER_06: San Francisco's zoning laws try to tell people who counts as a family.
(0:21:03) SPEAKER_06: If we want to be a more affordable city, we have to start by legalizing the way real San Franciscans live.
(0:21:10) SPEAKER_06: Under current law, households of more than five unrelated individuals who do not cook meals together must meet group housing standards, often making older homes with housemates technically non-compliant.
(0:21:23) SPEAKER_06: So today I'm introducing the shared housing reform act, which remedies this in several ways.
(0:21:29) SPEAKER_06: One, it replaces the term family with household throughout the planning code.
(0:21:34) SPEAKER_06: Two, it removes renumeric limits on unrelated residents living together.
(0:21:40) SPEAKER_06: Three, it establishes a nine lease threshold to distinguish shared households from institutional group housing.
(0:21:48) SPEAKER_06: Four, it recognizes shared financial responsibility like rent and utilities as the defining feature of a household.
(0:21:56) SPEAKER_06: And lastly, it aligns local law with state mandates to treat community care and recovery facilities serving six or fewer individuals as dwelling units.
(0:22:07) SPEAKER_06: The planning code was amended to limit the number of unrelated roommates that could live together around the time of the 1978 citywide downzoning process, often preventing builders and developers from building shared housing and co-op housing options to avoid enforcement by the city.
(0:22:23) SPEAKER_06: The city's planning department has taken 14 enforcement actions since 2020.
(0:22:29) SPEAKER_06: Reviewing the definition of family and its inclusion of non-related households was an explicit implementation recommendation of the housing element to ensure fair, inclusive, and equitable housing standards.
(0:22:42) SPEAKER_06: This is about fairness and this legislation recognizing that today's families and chosen families come in many forms.
(0:22:51) SPEAKER_06: If it's good enough for our inclusive values, it should be good enough for our zoning code as well.
(0:22:57) SPEAKER_06: Thanks to Josh Massimore, Mark Hogan, and Lisa Zoner for bringing this issue to my attention from the community.
(0:23:03) SPEAKER_06: Thanks to Heather Goodman and Julia Gualco Nelson from the city attorney's office.
(0:23:08) SPEAKER_06: Rainel Cooper and Jessica Gutierrez Garcia from my office.
(0:23:12) SPEAKER_06: And Liz Wadi, Erin Starr, Dan Cider, and Audrey Merlone from the planning department for their help on this legislation.
(0:23:20) SPEAKER_06: Lastly, thank you to my colleagues, Supervisor Sotter, Cheryl, and Melgar for their early co-sponsorship.
(0:23:25) SPEAKER_06: The rest I submit.
(0:23:27) SPEAKER_05: Thank you, Supervisor Mahmoud.
(0:23:29) SPEAKER_05: Supervisor Mandelman.
(0:23:31) SPEAKER_07: Thank you, Madam Clerk.
(0:23:32) SPEAKER_07: Colleagues, today I am introducing an ordinance to update the administrative code sections governing the Domestic Violence Shelter-Based Program Fund to ensure that our laws reflect the reality of how gender-based violence prevention work is being delivered in San Francisco.
(0:23:46) SPEAKER_07: As part of last year's budget process, it was contemplated that the gender-based violence grant portfolio
(0:23:51) SPEAKER_07: would move from the Department on the Status of Women to the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development.
(0:23:56) SPEAKER_07: That transition is now well underway.
(0:23:58) SPEAKER_07: MoCD conducted a full procurement process in late 2024 and early 2025.
(0:24:02) SPEAKER_07: The new grant agreements with community-based organizations are set to begin today, July 1st.
(0:24:09) SPEAKER_07: Notwithstanding that transition, our administrative code still assigns oversight of the domestic violence shelter-based program fund to the department on the status of women.
(0:24:18) SPEAKER_07: This ordinance corrects that outdated provision and formally moves administration of the fund to MoCD, the department now charged with overseeing this work.
(0:24:26) SPEAKER_07: The legislation also addresses a number of other inconsistencies and outdated references in the code.

(0:26:35) SPEAKER_03: Don't ask me how I know that.
(0:26:38) SPEAKER_03: Congratulations to the Mayor to have accepted finally to start taking down the 5G towers even though he doesn't want to confess about it yet because his handler might be a bit problematic for that.

(0:29:58) SPEAKER_07: All right, we will now take a break from public comment and go to our 230 special order madam clerk It's now time for the recognition of commendations for meritorious service to the city and county of San Francisco We work","Supervisor Walton introduced a resolution calling for the creation of a small business relief fund to support merchants impacted by the upcoming Islayas Creek Bridge replacement project on Third Street, which will close the corridor for three years starting January 2027. The resolution emphasizes the need to protect legacy, immigrant-owned, and Black and Brown-owned businesses that are already vulnerable. He also presented an in memoriam honoring Byron Rhett, a longtime public servant who played a key role in shaping San Francisco through projects like Pier 1 revitalization and Crane Cove Park.

Supervisor Chan introduced two resolutions: one supporting KQED union workers (Local 51) in their push for reinvestment in local programming and opposition to outsourcing; and another urging San Francisco to formally oppose state Senate Bill 79 unless it is significantly amended, citing concerns over displacement of tenants and small businesses, lack of protections, and absence of funding for affordable housing.

Supervisor Dorsey introduced a resolution urging Blue Shield of California and UCSF Health to resolve their contract dispute, which threatens healthcare access for thousands of San Francisco city workers and retirees. Despite a recent 30-day extension in negotiations, uncertainty remains for those relying on UCSF providers.

Supervisor Fiedler introduced a resolution designating July 12th as Toucan Day, marking the fifth anniversary of the District Nine Block Party that honors Sean Montrose, a young man killed by police in 2020. The resolution celebrates his legacy through community events, art, and social justice initiatives named in his memory.

Supervisor Mahmod introduced the Shared Housing Reform Act, aimed at modernizing the city's planning code by replacing the term ""family"" with ""household"" and removing numeric limits on unrelated individuals living together. The ordinance aligns with state housing mandates and supports current resident arrangements that may otherwise be at risk of enforcement.

Supervisor Mandelman presented an ordinance updating administrative code sections related to the Domestic Violence Shelter-Based Program Fund, transferring oversight from the Department on the Status of Women to the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to match where the work is currently being managed. The legislation corrects outdated references and inconsistencies in the code.

Public comment included remarks from individuals addressing various topics such as predicted societal events, technology implementation, and veterans' justice issues. The meeting then transitioned into a special order recognizing commendations for meritorious service to San Francisco.",{}

(0:31:23) SPEAKER_05: Through decades of tireless work and education,
(0:31:26) SPEAKER_05: government and community organizing, Diane has remained rooted in the belief that when one of us succeeds, we all succeed.
(0:31:35) SPEAKER_05: A principle she has instilled in generations through her signature mantra, my success is your success.
(0:31:43) SPEAKER_05: As co-founder of 100% College Prep, Diane transformed the educational landscape for hundreds of students from Bayview Hunters Point and across San Francisco.
(0:31:54) SPEAKER_05: Her vision and leadership have not only paved the way for countless first-generation college students, but has also helped ensure that our young people are supported from high school and through college completion.
(0:32:08) SPEAKER_05: Through initiatives like Jumpstart to College and Get Through College, Diane created a motto for long-term success, especially for students too often overlooked.
(0:32:21) SPEAKER_05: Diane has also made an indelible impact as education director at Young Community Developers and in her roles across multiple city departments, including the San Francisco Police Commission, I mean, I'm sorry, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, San Francisco Treasurer's Office, and San Francisco Unified School District.
(0:32:45) SPEAKER_05: She has served over 20 years as a city and county employee, always bringing integrity, compassion, and excellence to her work.
(0:32:56) SPEAKER_05: Her legacy is not only in her professional accomplishments, but in her civic leadership.
(0:33:02) SPEAKER_05: Diane has been a vital force in efforts like the Black to the Future Initiative,
(0:33:08) SPEAKER_05: my brother and sister's keeper, Mega Black San Francisco, and numerous advisory bodies and commissions.
(0:33:17) SPEAKER_05: All dedicated to ensuring that equity and justice are more than just ideals, but lived realities in San Francisco.

(0:33:37) SPEAKER_05: Jefferson Silver Award and honors from national and local black organization.
(0:33:44) SPEAKER_05: But no award can fully capture the profound impact Diane has had on the city and the people in it.
(0:33:51) SPEAKER_05: Diane, your retirement marks the close of a powerful chapter, but your legacy will continue to shape the future of San Francisco for generations to come.
(0:34:03) SPEAKER_05: On behalf of the residents of District 10 and a grateful city, I want to thank you for your unwavering service, your love for community and your belief in our youth.
(0:34:15) SPEAKER_05: With deepest respect and admiration, we thank you and congratulate you on your retirement.
(0:34:22) Unknown: Thank you.
(0:34:37) SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much honorable supervisor of the illustrious district 10.
(0:34:44) SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much for honoring me today and and to the rest of the board commissioners and board president.
(0:34:54) SPEAKER_02: It has been truly a blessing to support and help our young people fly when they didn't know they had wings and
(0:35:04) SPEAKER_02: In 1999, my cousin and I were just volunteering in our community and had a conversation with a group of young teens, young women that we were helping and volunteering with and had a conversation about college and career and didn't like what we heard.
(0:35:26) SPEAKER_02: And so we just got together and a one day a week girls group turned into a second day of a college club.
(0:35:34) SPEAKER_02: And we had no intentions of this 25 years later in nonprofit world.
(0:35:41) SPEAKER_02: We were just supporting young people in our community and making sure that they had what they need to come back and be great citizens in our city.
(0:35:50) SPEAKER_02: And so today after 25 years, it's time to pass the torch.
(0:35:56) SPEAKER_02: We have gotten hundreds of young people in college and through college to persist through college.
(0:36:05) SPEAKER_02: Today we have hundreds of students who have college degrees, they have master degrees, and we have two that have their PhD or EDDs.
(0:36:22) SPEAKER_02: And a grand number of those students come from the Bay View Hunters Point community, but we also serve young people all over our city.
(0:36:32) SPEAKER_02: And we've been able to partner with many of the organizations here in the city and beyond.
(0:36:39) SPEAKER_02: I have my team here of coaches, could not do this alone.
(0:36:44) SPEAKER_02: I would love for them to stand up and just be seen.
(0:36:47) SPEAKER_02: The work that we've done has been in community.
(0:36:52) SPEAKER_02: And really quickly, the work that we have done as Supervisor Walton just mentioned has been in community, and it's also been in our schools.
(0:37:09) SPEAKER_02: And when I left City Hall as a special assistant to the treasurer,
(0:37:16) SPEAKER_02: I went over to the San Francisco Unified School District because of the work that I was doing in the community.
(0:37:22) SPEAKER_02: It took a pretty good pay cut, but I had prayed about it.
(0:37:29) SPEAKER_02: And I knew what my mission was, and God had given me that mission and that purpose.
(0:37:35) SPEAKER_02: And then I left the Unified School District to focus on the work that we were doing in the community.
(0:37:39) SPEAKER_02: So again, it's been a blessing to work with our young people, to see them come back and make a difference in our city.
(0:37:47) SPEAKER_02: A number of them have worked right here with our city and city hall and city agencies.
(0:37:53) SPEAKER_02: And so that is the work of 100%, and that's the work
(0:37:58) SPEAKER_02: that will continue on in the
(0:38:02) SPEAKER_02: the next chapter and the next journey, the next phase of 100% will be in that leadership.
(0:38:07) SPEAKER_02: So I focus on cultivating the next group of leaders so that they will continue this work that we need so desperately to do and that we need.
(0:38:18) SPEAKER_02: And we will continue to work with our school district as well side by side with them to make sure that our young people have what they need.
(0:38:26) SPEAKER_02: So again, thank you so much.
(0:38:29) SPEAKER_02: Again, it's been a true blessing.
(0:38:30) SPEAKER_02: Today is my first day as Billy Wang said, re-wirement, re-wirement, because I will stay, you know, I will stay in the community and I will continue to do this work as a forever founder.
(0:38:49) SPEAKER_02: So thank you again so much.
(0:38:50) SPEAKER_02: Appreciate your time and your recognition today.
(0:39:36) SPEAKER_12: We're still waiting Supervisor Dorsey, right?
(0:39:38) SPEAKER_12: Okay.
(0:39:40) SPEAKER_12: Let's go to District 3 Supervisor Sotter.
(0:39:43) SPEAKER_01: Right.
(0:39:44) SPEAKER_01: Thank you, President Mandelman.
(0:39:46) SPEAKER_01: You know, the calendar may say that Pride is over, but since we're San Francisco, we're going to keep things going a little longer and today recognize Scott Taylor, the owner of the Cinch Saloon.
(0:39:57) SPEAKER_01: Scott, would you come join us at the podium?
(0:40:05) SPEAKER_01: The cinch opened in 1974 on Polk Street, meaning it is one of the city's oldest gay bars.
(0:40:12) SPEAKER_01: And that is exactly why in the past few years, there's been so much concern and anxiety as rumors swirled about the future of the cinch.
(0:40:21) SPEAKER_01: But to our great relief, Scott stepped in last month as the new owner.
(0:40:26) SPEAKER_01: And from talking to him and hearing from his patrons, I know he's doing this because he feels a responsibility and a calling to carry the cinch forward.
(0:40:35) SPEAKER_01: Scott brings more than two decades of hospitality experience, and he is a longtime love and history at the cinch.
(0:40:42) SPEAKER_01: He first visited more than 20 years ago, and he even had his first date with his partner at the cinch.
(0:40:48) SPEAKER_01: Today, the cinch might be among the last gay bars on Polk Street, but it reminds us of the role that Polk Street has played in our LGBTQ plus history.
(0:40:59) SPEAKER_01: Some of the most prominent gay bars of the 1950s and 60s were on Polk Street, Corner Pocket, The Jumping Frog, and Busbys.
(0:41:06) SPEAKER_01: The first gay business association in the entire country, Tavern Guild of San Francisco, was comprised mostly of Polk Street merchants.
(0:41:16) SPEAKER_01: And the first San Francisco Pride Parade happened not on Market Street or in the Castro, but along Polk Street in 1972.
(0:41:24) SPEAKER_01: Think Scott said it best when he said, in a city where so many LGBTQ plus landmarks have disappeared, protecting these spaces is more important than ever.
(0:41:35) SPEAKER_01: The cinch isn't just a bar, it's a living piece of queer history, and now it is secured for the next generation to celebrate, gather, and thrive.
(0:41:46) SPEAKER_01: Scott, I want to appreciate all the work that you're doing that you have done and that you will do going forward.
(0:41:52) SPEAKER_01: It is not easy to take a leap into what you're doing, into owning a small business in San Francisco, into owning a bar, and especially one with such high expectations, such a treasured place in so many people's hearts.
(0:42:06) SPEAKER_01: So thank you for doing that.
(0:42:08) SPEAKER_01: Thank you for making sure that the cinch will live on for another generation.
(0:42:12) SPEAKER_01: And with that, I'd love to hear if you want to share any words.
(0:42:16) SPEAKER_11: Well, thank you very much for the recognition.
(0:42:26) SPEAKER_11: I very much appreciate this coming out of the Board of Supervisors and especially Supervisor Souter's office.
(0:42:34) SPEAKER_11: We do what we can to preserve these spaces for the community because they are shrinking and
(0:42:43) SPEAKER_11: It's our responsibility as a community to kind of uplift these positions and to be able to kind of keep these safe spaces open for people moving forward.
(0:43:00) SPEAKER_11: So thank you again.
(0:43:01) SPEAKER_11: I appreciate the recognition and look forward to working together moving forward.
(0:43:39) SPEAKER_12: I would note that we have been joined by former congressman, president of the California State Senate and Democratic Party Chair of the State of California, John Burton, as well as... As well as our former colleague and former president of this board, Aaron Peskin.
(0:44:11) SPEAKER_12: As well as former assemblyman, former president of this board and current city attorney, attorney David Chu.
(0:44:23) SPEAKER_12: So something is up.
(0:44:26) SPEAKER_12: D6 supervisor Matt Dorsey.
(0:44:29) SPEAKER_07: Thank you, President Mandelman.
(0:44:30) SPEAKER_07: Colleagues, on the occasion of her retirement, I have the great honor today of recognizing a remarkable public servant who happens also to be a friend and former city attorney's office colleague of mine whose career has been distinguished by extraordinary leadership and by a fierce commitment to justice and equity, Kamiko Burton.
(0:44:52) SPEAKER_07: Kamiko, take the lecture.
(0:44:58) SPEAKER_07: Kamiko is a proud San Franciscan, a graduate of Lowell High School.
(0:45:04) SPEAKER_07: You see Davis.
(0:45:05) SPEAKER_07: You see Hastings.
(0:45:07) SPEAKER_07: Now you see...
(0:45:09) SPEAKER_07: You see law San Francisco, and someone who has spent more than three decades fighting effectively and well for our city's most disadvantaged.
(0:45:17) SPEAKER_07: To those of us who know Kimmy, of course, that's no surprise.
(0:45:20) SPEAKER_07: She comes from a family whose commitment to public service is legendary, including her father, John Barton, who's here today, as you mentioned, an extraordinary
(0:45:31) SPEAKER_07: Assemblymember, Senator, Senate President, Congressman, Chair of the California Democratic Party, and not least an extraordinary father who instilled in his no less extraordinary daughter a passion for justice and a tireless drive to fight for those who are vulnerable and most in need of fighters.
(0:45:50) SPEAKER_07: Kimiko Barton joined the city attorney's office 22 years ago, not long after I joined that office, in fact, as team leader of the child and family team, now the dependency and mental health team.
(0:46:02) SPEAKER_07: She has led that team's vitally important work ever since, overseeing two confidential court-based practices with very heavy and active court caseloads.
(0:46:12) SPEAKER_07: It is work that is never in the limelight, and its heroes are always unsung.
(0:46:17) SPEAKER_07: Kimmy's team handled caseloads that routinely involve some of the most complex cases, and many of the most difficult issues known in human endeavor.
(0:46:27) SPEAKER_07: Representing the interests of abused and neglected children, working with protective services workers, and handling mental health conservatorships in care court.
(0:46:36) SPEAKER_07: Kimmy and her team advised the Families and Children Services Division of the Human Services Agency in all phases
(0:46:42) SPEAKER_07: of dependency litigation.
(0:46:44) SPEAKER_07: It's a team that serves as advice counsel as well as litigation counsel on more than 600 conservatorships cases in San Francisco.
(0:46:53) SPEAKER_07: Kimmy has guided that work tirelessly with compassion, humanity and professionalism in a steady hand.
(0:46:59) SPEAKER_07: appearing in court nearly every day during the pandemic, leading her team through major system changes and preparing for and implementing the most significant update to California's conservatorship laws in more than 50 years.
(0:47:13) SPEAKER_07: Beyond her legal acumen, however, Kimiko has also been a powerful force for equity within the city attorney's office.
(0:47:19) SPEAKER_07: For the past two years, she served on the Racial Equity Task Force.
(0:47:25) SPEAKER_07: First as a member, then as co-chair, helping lead new initiatives like that office's law fellow program and its internship partnership with Howard University School of Law.
(0:47:36) SPEAKER_07: She has also been an active member of the Asian Pacific American Alliance since its founding in 2021, helping to strengthen the community and visibility for AAPI staff.
(0:47:46) SPEAKER_07: Kimmy's colleagues describe her as a fierce advocate, a thoughtful mentor, a supportive leader, and someone who brings humor and heart to every space she's in.
(0:47:55) SPEAKER_07: Further enhancing my affection for her, she's also a diehard fan of the 49ers and two of my highest profile constituents, our Golden State Warriors and your San Francisco Giants.
(0:48:05) SPEAKER_09: and our Golden State Valkyries.
(0:48:07) SPEAKER_07: That's right, the Valkyries.
(0:48:11) SPEAKER_07: Comico Burton, on behalf of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, it is my honor to commend you for your years of service to our city for bringing hope where there is hopelessness, for giving voice to the voiceless, for doing justice, and for making ours a city that is truly the city of St.
(0:48:30) SPEAKER_07: Francis.
(0:48:31) SPEAKER_07: We thank you and we congratulate you on your well-earned return.
(0:49:02) SPEAKER_12: If I might just add...
(0:49:06) SPEAKER_12: an expression of gratitude to Kimiko Burton.
(0:49:10) SPEAKER_12: I have had the great good fortune of being able to work with you over my last seven years on this board where I have been interested in the areas where you have been practicing in the city attorney's office.
(0:49:21) SPEAKER_12: And you have had the misfortune of practicing in an area where so many politicians have had so many demands over that time.
(0:49:29) SPEAKER_12: And you have carried on gracefully and consistently with the law
(0:49:34) SPEAKER_12: and tried to explain to politicians and others who may not always understand what the law requires, what it does require, and also explain some of the challenges about actually making progress in some of these really hard areas.
(0:49:48) SPEAKER_12: So you are, as Supervisor Dorsey said, funny and charming and a great lawyer, and it's been an honor to be able to work with you.
(0:50:04) SPEAKER_12: And it looks like your boss might want to say something.
(0:50:10) SPEAKER_12: Former boss, former boss.
(0:50:13) Unknown: David Chu.
(0:50:21) SPEAKER_06: Good afternoon, Mr. President, supervisors.
(0:50:25) SPEAKER_06: We appreciate you taking a moment to acknowledge an incredible honoree.
(0:50:30) SPEAKER_06: Our San Francisco City Attorney's Office has been blessed to have legions of amazing legal professionals who've graced our office and our city government.
(0:50:39) SPEAKER_06: But as I've said at now, several retirement celebrations.
(0:50:43) SPEAKER_06: When Kimmy Burton started with the city, she broke the mold.
(0:50:47) SPEAKER_06: As she leaves the city, she has shattered the mold with a few F bombs in between.
(0:50:55) SPEAKER_06: Some 34 years ago, as Supervisor Dorsey has laid out, she started serving our city.
(0:51:01) SPEAKER_06: And like Burton's before her, including the incredible 92-year-old Burton, who is gracing our presence today, she has given voice to the voiceless.
(0:51:12) SPEAKER_06: She has fought for the most vulnerable among us, whether it be countless individuals facing criminal charges when she was a deputy public defender,
(0:51:21) SPEAKER_06: or her work on behalf of hundreds of children in child abuse and neglect cases, or countless unhoused individuals or individuals with mental health challenges.
(0:51:34) SPEAKER_06: She has served in her office as the head of our child and family team and the head of our mental health and dependency team, leading her team and her office through many, many changes in the law over the decades.
(0:51:47) SPEAKER_06: Reforms in our criminal justice system, implementing our new care court system, preparing for incredible updates to our conservorship law.
(0:51:56) SPEAKER_06: And over the years, she has served not just thousands of San Franciscans, but she has guided dozens and dozens of incredible legal professionals through their work.
(0:52:06) SPEAKER_06: And I speak on their behalf.
(0:52:08) SPEAKER_06: She's been an incredible mentor and a model for legions of public servants.
(0:52:13) SPEAKER_06: And if that is not enough, she is someone who has been a champion for equity and opportunity within our office and our city as our ongoing chair of our racial equity task force.
(0:52:25) SPEAKER_06: There is no one who has been a more fierce or strategic advocate for the causes that she has led.
(0:52:30) SPEAKER_06: There's no one who has a bigger heart.
(0:52:33) SPEAKER_06: And there's no one who is sassier.
(0:52:37) SPEAKER_06: And so on behalf of the best municipal office in the country, as we lose one of the very best of our ranks, we want to wish her the very best as she starts a new phase in her life.
(0:52:50) SPEAKER_06: Our best to you.
(0:52:51) SPEAKER_06: We love you, Kimmy Burton.
(0:53:06) SPEAKER_09: He said, I can't swear.
(0:53:08) SPEAKER_09: I feel like I've been called to the principal's office.
(0:53:12) SPEAKER_09: Matt, Supervisor Dorsey, sorry.
(0:53:15) SPEAKER_09: Thank you so much and to all of the members of this August board.
(0:53:20) SPEAKER_09: And Angela, I remember when we were baby city employees together and girl, look at you now.
(0:53:26) SPEAKER_09: Thank you Rafael and everyone.
(0:53:28) SPEAKER_09: Shout out to my supervisor, Shaman.
(0:53:32) SPEAKER_09: The biggest shout out to my family
(0:53:33) SPEAKER_09: My mom couldn't be here and my son is working, but my daughter and my dad are here and without my family, none of this would be possible.
(0:53:43) SPEAKER_09: They have worn the sacrifices.
(0:53:45) SPEAKER_09: They have borne sacrifice as I have done my work over the last 34 years, so for that I am grateful.
(0:53:53) SPEAKER_09: I also need to give my mom a shout out.
(0:53:55) SPEAKER_09: Everybody talks about the Burton legacy, which is amazing, but I come from it on both sides.
(0:54:00) SPEAKER_09: My grandfather on my mom's side was a labor organizer when it was very unpopular to be a labor organizer and one got thrown into prison for such things, which my grandfather did.
(0:54:10) SPEAKER_09: So I come from it on both sides.
(0:54:12) SPEAKER_09: I am a Burton, I am a Hall, and I am a Nogawa, and I am proud of all of that.
(0:54:18) SPEAKER_09: David, thank you so much for
(0:54:20) SPEAKER_09: Keeping me?
(0:54:21) SPEAKER_09: When you came on, we haven't had as many years, but it has been a wonderful ride with you.
(0:54:28) SPEAKER_09: So thank you for your leadership and the way that you run this office.
(0:54:32) SPEAKER_09: Shout out to Yvonne Marais.
(0:54:34) SPEAKER_09: I don't even know what your title is, but whatever it is, the best one, in my view, that the office has ever had.
(0:54:41) SPEAKER_09: Our team does work that
(0:54:43) SPEAKER_09: But as Matt said in Ruffianos, don't hit the headlines unless something really, really bad has happened.
(0:54:49) SPEAKER_09: So we do like to stay out of the paper.
(0:54:53) SPEAKER_09: But Yvonne has thrown herself into becoming familiar with the work that we do and is such a tremendous support to my team, former team.
(0:55:03) SPEAKER_09: And I know how much she will support Diana Carpahall-Straight, who is here in the audience, who has taken over the leadership of this remarkable team.
(0:55:12) SPEAKER_09: So much of my team is here today and I thank you guys so much for being here.
(0:55:16) SPEAKER_09: I know you guys don't even all come in on Tuesdays So thank you for coming in for that and to I see a number of my colleagues my former colleague Julie Thank you, but thank you everybody for being here Chris shout out co-chair of APAA
(0:55:36) SPEAKER_09: Thank you for the work that you continue to do for the city and for the work that our team does that is largely unknown and under the radar as it should be, but you guys do remarkable work.
(0:55:48) SPEAKER_09: Never forget that.
(0:55:49) SPEAKER_09: Never forget that you are kick butt.
(0:55:52) SPEAKER_09: Attorneys that you guys can carry anybody's water in court and that I would come to you guys with any legal problem and want you guys to be the one carrying my bag There's other words that come to mind.
(0:56:07) SPEAKER_09: I'm trying to be trying to behave.
(0:56:09) SPEAKER_09: Anyway, thank you so much.
(0:56:10) SPEAKER_09: I really appreciate this honor.
(0:56:11) SPEAKER_09: I'm gonna stop talking.
(0:56:12) SPEAKER_09: Thank you so much
(0:56:40) Unknown: Thank you.
(0:57:37) SPEAKER_12: Okay, next up, District 9, Supervisor Fielder.
(0:57:42) SPEAKER_00: Thanks, President Manelman.
(0:57:45) SPEAKER_00: Colleagues, today I have the distinct pleasure of honoring my dear friends and D9 small business owners, Charlie and Chrissy Harb, owners of Charlie's Cafe.
(0:57:55) SPEAKER_00: Please come to the podium.
(0:58:02) SPEAKER_00: Charlie's Cafe has been a beloved fixture in Bernal Heights that has been in operation for over 24 years.
(0:58:08) SPEAKER_00: It's been a central gathering spot on the Procedure Park side of Bernal Heights since 2001.
(0:58:15) SPEAKER_00: Before the cafe came into being in 1989, Chrissy drove across the country from her hometown of Detroit to live in San Francisco with her brother and attend City College.
(0:58:26) SPEAKER_00: A native of Palestine, Charlie attended Bethlehem University as an undergrad and went on to graduate school for architecture in Jerusalem.
(0:58:35) SPEAKER_00: When the uprising of 1987 broke out, the resulting political turmoil and dangerous road closures and blockades forced Charlie to leave his studies in Jerusalem and earn his degree in architecture from U.C.
(0:58:47) SPEAKER_00: Berkeley.
(0:58:49) SPEAKER_00: Charlie met his wife and life partner Chrissy in 1991.
(0:58:53) SPEAKER_00: Their two wonderful kids, Dahlia and Jerry's, grew up in the cafe.
(0:58:57) SPEAKER_00: In 2001, Charlie bought a little corner business with his sister Raida, who was planning to run a cafe with her husband.
(0:59:07) SPEAKER_00: Shortly after purchase, Raida, then pregnant with her third child, decided to move her family to Canada and left the business in the hands of Chrissy and Charlie, who established what has become a regular stop for hundreds of neighbors from throughout Bernal and the mission.
(0:59:24) SPEAKER_00: These neighbors all call Charlie and Chrissy their good friends because once you enter their door you are brought immediately into their orbit of friendship.
(0:59:34) SPEAKER_00: And today you can see that in action with the group from the neighborhood that has come to cheer them on.
(0:59:40) SPEAKER_00: Over the years... Over the years they have amassed a broad dedicated community who adore them, some of whom are here,
(0:59:53) SPEAKER_00: And over the years, Charlie has employed a wide diversity of people who come from all over the world.
(0:59:58) SPEAKER_00: The current staff, Areli, Christina, Jose, and Alexi contribute so much to making the cafe warm and welcoming.
(1:00:08) SPEAKER_00: On any given day, they can be found working behind the counter, juggling multiple orders, preparing the food, and always treating each customer with a big smile.
(1:00:17) SPEAKER_00: What sets this place apart from others is the sense of familiarity and joy and community when you walk in the door.
(1:00:27) SPEAKER_00: Charlie and Chrissy have dedicated themselves to creating a space that is an expression of love for the community, and they continue to do this despite the difficulties of keeping a small business afloat in San Francisco.
(1:00:41) SPEAKER_00: Through the years, they have hosted events that elevate important social issues and promote art, poetry, and music.
(1:00:49) SPEAKER_00: They host cultural celebrations and fundraisers for Palestine, Ukraine, and all manner of local and global issues.
(1:00:57) SPEAKER_00: During the pandemic, they opened a parklet and held outdoor live bluegrass jams on Friday mornings and weekends that continue to this day, including a Thursday night pop-up as well as a pop-up on Friday mornings.
(1:01:10) SPEAKER_00: Whether it's helping build connections among neighbors or just offering a relaxing place to hang out and have a bite, Charlie's Cafe is always there.
(1:01:19) SPEAKER_00: I just want to thank you all for being such a pillar in the community and for all you do for District 9.
(1:01:49) SPEAKER_10: Thank you.
(1:01:51) SPEAKER_10: Thank you, President and board members.
(1:01:56) SPEAKER_10: I just wanted to announce that we're retiring too, since it looks like everybody before us is retired.
(1:02:02) SPEAKER_10: Maybe we keep up the same theme.
(1:02:06) SPEAKER_10: We're very humbled.
(1:02:08) SPEAKER_10: especially with the previous people who were ahead of us.
(1:02:12) SPEAKER_10: We feel like we're just living our lifestyle and we're doing our normal life.
(1:02:19) SPEAKER_10: I don't think running a small business in San Francisco is a business.
(1:02:23) SPEAKER_10: I feel like it's just a way of life.
(1:02:29) SPEAKER_10: You spend 10 hours a day, seven days a week among these people.
(1:02:47) SPEAKER_10: We're very honored to what we do.
(1:02:49) SPEAKER_10: Christian and I, 24 years, worked day and night in the beginning.
(1:02:55) SPEAKER_10: It's very hard, but we made it happen.
(1:02:58) SPEAKER_10: I mean, like I said, we have a huge family.
(1:03:01) SPEAKER_10: I mean, we have thousands of people.
(1:03:02) SPEAKER_10: We consider very close friends.
(1:03:06) SPEAKER_10: And a few people are here, but everyone makes a difference to us and make us get up at six o'clock in the morning and go open up and wait for a smile.
(1:03:14) SPEAKER_10: Somebody to come and check on us.
(1:03:17) SPEAKER_10: especially the last few years for what's happening in the old country.
(1:03:21) SPEAKER_10: Everybody comes in, we're talking about hundreds of people a day, come and check on my mom and my brother and my family.
(1:03:28) SPEAKER_10: So we feel we're part of the city.
(1:03:30) SPEAKER_10: I've been here 35 years and as an immigrant, I don't feel as an immigrant at all compared to everybody around us.
(1:03:38) SPEAKER_10: San Francisco is very special, it's really.
(1:03:41) SPEAKER_10: I never left it.
(1:03:42) SPEAKER_10: People are, how come you never tried somewhere else?
(1:03:44) SPEAKER_10: I'm like, because this is home now.
(1:03:47) SPEAKER_10: Thank you.
(1:03:52) SPEAKER_10: My extended family, my mom's family came here in the 70s and my great uncles came here in the 60s and they never left either.
(1:04:00) SPEAKER_10: I mean, it's a place to be comfortable as a foreigner to make it home.
(1:04:08) SPEAKER_10: We really appreciate this honor and we're humbled to have it.
(1:04:11) SPEAKER_10: Thank you so much.
(1:04:19) SPEAKER_00: Is it still on?
(1:04:21) SPEAKER_08: I just wanna thank all of you guys for being here and supporting us for so many years.
(1:05:06) Unknown: Thank you
(1:05:40) SPEAKER_12: All right.
(1:05:41) SPEAKER_12: And finally, from District 8, I am going to invite Debbie Lerman to come on up.
(1:05:59) SPEAKER_12: Colleagues, today it is my honor to present a special commendation to Debbie Lerman, who earlier this year retired after more than two decades as the director of the San Francisco Human Services Network and a 40-year career of advocacy, community organizing, and public service.
(1:06:16) SPEAKER_12: Since 2001, Debbie led the Human Services Network, a coalition of nearly 80 non-profit health and human service providers that serve thousands of San Franciscans every day.
(1:06:27) SPEAKER_12: Under her direction, the network has become one of the most trusted voices for the city's safety net, advocating for fair funding, effective policy, and a more equitable partnership between government and the nonprofit sector.
(1:06:39) SPEAKER_12: She's guided the coalition through multiple budget crises, defended critical services from cuts, and helped shape the values that now anchor San Francisco's human services funding framework.
(1:06:49) SPEAKER_12: In every meeting, every hearing, every hallway conversation at City Hall, Debbie has shown up, relentless, prepared, and always grounded in the needs of those most impacted.
(1:06:59) SPEAKER_12: Before joining the network, Debbie served in a range of leadership roles that reflect her commitment to economic justice and opportunity.
(1:07:05) SPEAKER_12: from placing low-income workers into good union construction jobs to managing coalitions focused on environmental and health equity to raising funds and building capacity for countless local nonprofits.
(1:07:17) SPEAKER_12: A proud alum of MIT and UC Berkeley School of Law, Go Bears, Debbie brought rigor, strategy, and a sense of purpose to every role she held.
(1:07:30) SPEAKER_12: She's also been a tireless volunteer and organizer, raising money for frontline organizations, counseling students in crisis, and working the floor at San Francisco's iconic music venues for decades as a volunteer usher and supervisor.
(1:07:44) SPEAKER_12: Throughout her career, Debbie has combined sharp policy analysis with grassroots sensibility, never losing sight of the people behind the programs.
(1:07:52) SPEAKER_12: She's been a steady champion for nonprofit workers for better contracting practices
(1:07:57) SPEAKER_12: and for a city that invests in the people and organizations that hold our social fabric together.
(1:08:02) SPEAKER_12: Her impact has been felt in nearly every human services budget the city has passed over the last 20 years.
(1:08:08) SPEAKER_12: On behalf of a grateful city, thank you Debbie for your passion, your persistence, your incredible mind, and your lifelong commitment to making San Francisco a more just and compassionate place.
(1:08:20) SPEAKER_12: Congratulations on your very well-earned retirement, and now the floor is yours.
(1:08:35) SPEAKER_03: Thank you, President Mendelman, for this honor.
(1:08:38) SPEAKER_03: It is very meaningful to me.
(1:08:41) SPEAKER_03: I was very nervous the first time I came up to this podium almost 25 years ago, and I'm a little nervous now.
(1:08:48) SPEAKER_04: Well, Debbie, we want to hear you better, so grab that microphone closer to you, please.
(1:08:53) SPEAKER_03: Got it, Angela.
(1:08:54) SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
(1:08:55) SPEAKER_03: One of the first things I did for the Human Services Network was organize a conference on the three-legged stool, the partnership between nonprofits, government, and the philanthropic sector.
(1:09:07) SPEAKER_03: And today it feels like that partnership's a little shaky.
(1:09:11) SPEAKER_03: We have some huge budget cuts, political attacks coming from well-moneyed interests, and a federal government that
(1:09:20) SPEAKER_03: is making the act of helping people almost subversive.
(1:09:25) SPEAKER_03: And it is shocking what we're going through today.
(1:09:28) SPEAKER_03: I would be remiss if I didn't mention the cost of doing business today.
(1:09:32) SPEAKER_03: I have used that phrase so many times that I've thought about training a parrot to just sit on my shoulder and say it over and over again until it sinks in.
(1:09:46) SPEAKER_03: Our nonprofits are a treasure.
(1:09:49) SPEAKER_03: You don't know what it's got till it's gone and the city must renew its commitment to sustaining our nonprofits to prevent unintended consequences and harm to the people that we serve.
(1:10:00) SPEAKER_03: And most important, I thank every frontline worker who has the hardest job in the city.
(1:10:06) SPEAKER_03: getting up in the morning and going out there to help people they deserve better wages.
(1:10:10) SPEAKER_03: I can speak personally what it's like to have a 45 year career in the nonprofit sector.
(1:10:16) SPEAKER_03: I've been able to get away with it because I have a rent control department.
(1:10:20) SPEAKER_03: I have cats instead of kids.
(1:10:22) SPEAKER_03: And yeah, I have a second job.
(1:10:24) SPEAKER_03: I do security at the Fillmore so I can go see live music that I can't afford on a nonprofit salary.
(1:10:30) SPEAKER_03: And it's not right to ask that of others who want to have a similar career path.
(1:10:37) SPEAKER_03: So we need to remain laser focused on that goal.
(1:10:40) SPEAKER_03: San Francisco has always been a leader and has always and will continue to make national change
(1:10:47) SPEAKER_03: by our example.
(1:10:49) SPEAKER_03: And so everything you do in this room is important.
(1:10:52) SPEAKER_03: It has been my privilege to be a part of that as an advocate for our sector and to help empower others to fill that role as well.
(1:11:02) SPEAKER_03: And I have the deepest gratitude to all of our nonprofits, their leaders, and their workers, to the Human Services Network's founders, Bruce Fisher and Anne Lazarus, who hired me 24 years ago,
(1:11:17) SPEAKER_03: and to our co-chairs, Steve Fields and Sherilyn Adams, who give so much of their time to HSN while struggling to run their own huge organizations, and to our new leader, Rocio Molina, who if you haven't met her yet, you're going to, and have every confidence in her ability to take on this next phase of HSN's work.
(1:11:43) SPEAKER_03: I think my partner Joel Gendler for supporting me, I couldn't
(1:11:46) SPEAKER_03: do this work without him.
(1:11:47) SPEAKER_03: And I thank every public official, department head, supervisor, mayor's office staff person, legislative staff, Angela, all of you who have stood up for our sector and who have supported better funding, better services,
(1:12:05) SPEAKER_03: and better pay for our workers.
(1:12:07) SPEAKER_03: And over the years, even the ones who, even when we've disagreed, I have to say that most have engaged in conversations with respect and substance and thoughtfulness, and I very much appreciate that.
(1:12:22) SPEAKER_03: So again, thank you, President Mandelman.
(1:12:25) SPEAKER_03: Thank you to the whole board.
(1:12:26) SPEAKER_03: Shout out to District One, my home for 35 years, and our great Supervisor, Connie Chan.
(1:12:32) SPEAKER_03: I'm sure this will not be the last you hear from me.
(1:12:35) SPEAKER_03: So, thank you.
(1:13:29) SPEAKER_12: All right, so I think that takes us back to public comment.
(1:13:34) SPEAKER_04: Yes, for those of you who still would like to provide public comment, please line up on your right hand side of the chamber.
(1:13:39) SPEAKER_04: We'll set the timer for two minutes.

(1:13:57) SPEAKER_08: Is that correct?
(1:13:58) SPEAKER_08: You were having dinner with him or something.
(1:14:01) SPEAKER_08: Is that correct?

(1:14:52) SPEAKER_08: A woman came out of this room because I think the door","The meeting segment focused on honoring several retiring public servants and community leaders for their decades of contributions to San Francisco. Supervisor Walton recognized Diane Gray, a long-time educator and community organizer from Bayview Hunters Point, for her work in founding 100% College Prep and supporting first-generation college students.

(1:16:24) SPEAKER_06: Thank you for all your time, every one of you in this whole room.
(1:16:29) SPEAKER_07: All right, welcome to our next speaker.
(1:16:30) SPEAKER_04: Okay.
(1:16:31) SPEAKER_04: Hello, my name is Leah McGeever and I live in D6.
(1:16:35) SPEAKER_04: During the trans march, the mayor was heckled away because he was not welcome there and it wasn't his fucking event.
(1:16:41) SPEAKER_04: On June 28th, the cisgender gay D6 supervisor had this to say to his transphobic conservative base,
(1:16:47) SPEAKER_04: This obnoxious behavior doesn't represent San Francisco's LGBTQ plus community, and our ally, Mayor Daniel Laurie, deserves better.
(1:16:55) SPEAKER_04: Everyone in the LGBTQ community needs to start calling out this embarrassing fringe that's badly hurting the cause of LGBTQ plus progress for all of us.
(1:17:05) SPEAKER_04: To me, this literally sounds like he's calling for people to bully us.
(1:17:08) SPEAKER_04: For what, decorum?
(1:17:10) SPEAKER_04: None of you represent the transgender community.
(1:17:14) SPEAKER_04: You should be supporting us, but you're not.
(1:17:18) SPEAKER_04: So shut the fuck up about how you think we should be protesting our oppression, our dehumanization, our demonization, and erasure from society.
(1:17:27) SPEAKER_04: Got that?
(1:17:29) SPEAKER_04: None of you gave a single fuck about the trans flag being taken away from the Pride flag-raising ceremony.
(1:17:36) SPEAKER_04: Black and brown trans women fought for your gay rights.
(1:17:40) SPEAKER_04: And are you giving any of your rights up voluntarily because of decorum decency?
(1:17:46) SPEAKER_04: Y'all have abandoned trans children and youth, which is unconscionable.
(1:17:50) SPEAKER_04: There's not one press release or statement about life-saving health care being taken away from children in this country.
(1:17:58) SPEAKER_04: Trans children.
(1:17:59) SPEAKER_04: How can you fucking abandon them knowing, because you think you know them better than yourselves?
(1:18:05) SPEAKER_04: I mean, you know yourself.
(1:18:07) SPEAKER_04: Just fuck off unless you're gonna fucking support us.
(1:18:12) SPEAKER_04: Aye aye aye indeed.
(1:18:13) SPEAKER_04: There was a drag artist, a queer Latinx one that was abducted last week by ICE.
(1:18:18) SPEAKER_04: One supervisor actually showed up for an event to support that person.
(1:18:22) SPEAKER_04: Another one said they're keeping tabs on it and everyone else is silent.
(1:18:27) SPEAKER_04: Is SF a transgender and immigrant sanctuary city or not?
(1:18:30) SPEAKER_04: And you'll be funny if this Mexican stole your job.
(1:18:35) SPEAKER_07: I've heard you make similar comments but being more articulate.
(1:18:40) SPEAKER_07: You have a good speaking ability.
(1:18:46) SPEAKER_07: Thank you for your comments.
(1:18:50) SPEAKER_07: Can we hear from our next speaker please?
(1:18:55) SPEAKER_00: Good afternoon.
(1:18:56) SPEAKER_00: I was born and raised in San Francisco.
(1:18:58) SPEAKER_00: I'm a renter and I've lived in my current home on the edge of Noe Valley in the mission for over 20 years.
(1:19:04) SPEAKER_00: I love this city.
(1:19:05) SPEAKER_00: I've always believed in its values, but right now I feel completely unprotected.
(1:19:09) SPEAKER_00: We hear a lot about tenant protections in San Francisco and rightly so.
(1:19:14) SPEAKER_00: But what happens when someone who is never on the lease, never screened, and never approved gains access to a unit and begins terrorizing roommates, threatening other tenants, harassing neighbors, damaging property, and violating court orders?
(1:19:28) SPEAKER_00: What happens when their behavior drives out lawful tenants, destabilizes entire buildings, and leaves neighbors to police their own safety?
(1:19:37) SPEAKER_00: What about the small business owners who have poured their life savings into these properties?
(1:19:42) SPEAKER_00: This isn't a one-time incident.
(1:19:44) SPEAKER_00: In my case, this individual has done the same thing at at least five other properties across San Francisco, and I'm sure there are others like him.
(1:19:53) SPEAKER_00: Bad actors who exploit gaps in our city laws.
(1:19:57) SPEAKER_00: Now it's happening again, this time in the flat directly below me.
(1:20:01) SPEAKER_00: I've gone to court.
(1:20:02) SPEAKER_00: I've obtained both a civil harassment restraining order and a criminal protective order.
(1:20:07) SPEAKER_00: I've filed reports.
(1:20:08) SPEAKER_00: I've called 911.
(1:20:10) SPEAKER_00: But the police are stretched so thin they often don't respond at all, or they show up hours later when the danger has passed.
(1:20:17) SPEAKER_00: Even clear violations of court orders are treated as optional.
(1:20:22) SPEAKER_00: There is no coordinated city response, no accountability, no safety net for longtime residents like me who are being terrorized in our own homes.
(1:20:32) SPEAKER_00: I've had to move my dogs to safety.
(1:20:34) SPEAKER_00: I'm currently taking time off work to pack up my life, not because I want to leave, but because I no longer feel safe staying.
(1:20:40) SPEAKER_00: This is a systemic failure.
(1:20:42) SPEAKER_00: There are no city resources for master tenants or longtime residents to turn to when things go off the rails.
(1:20:48) SPEAKER_00: And yet we're the ones left holding the bag, paying lawyers, losing wages, calling 911, managing trauma and fearing for our safety in our own homes.
(1:20:58) SPEAKER_00: This is not just a personal crisis or a housing dispute.
(1:21:00) SPEAKER_00: Thank you so much.
(1:21:01) SPEAKER_00: It's a failure of city policy.
(1:21:02) SPEAKER_00: Your time has elapsed.
(1:21:03) SPEAKER_08: Thank you.
(1:21:03) SPEAKER_08: Thank you for sharing.
(1:21:04) SPEAKER_08: Next speaker, please you have you can leave it on the dais there and we'll pick it up Thank you so much next speaker, please you have two minutes Good afternoon supervisors, my name is andraper and I'm Stephanie's mother I own the building she lives in and pays rent for
(1:21:31) SPEAKER_01: I have an unlawful detainer proceeding going against this individual.
(1:21:36) SPEAKER_01: It's a nine-month process.
(1:21:38) SPEAKER_01: I will see it through to the end.
(1:21:40) SPEAKER_01: He's attempting to extort me to pay him money to leave, but what he's really extorting me for is the harassment of five women who lived in my building.
(1:21:50) SPEAKER_01: Three of them are gone.
(1:21:52) SPEAKER_01: None of these women deserve to be harassed, and there's something you can do about it.
(1:21:57) SPEAKER_01: You can take a look at who is slipping through the cracks.
(1:22:01) SPEAKER_01: A lot of these policies and rent ordinances are a good thing, but they're always people that can evade them and get around them.
(1:22:11) SPEAKER_01: Three roommates of this individual left the building each in a panic, an accounting analyst, a preschool teacher, and a woman that takes care of dogs.
(1:22:22) SPEAKER_01: These are women that should have been safe living in a unit.
(1:22:26) SPEAKER_01: He removes all the smoke protectors.
(1:22:28) SPEAKER_01: He won't let me in.
(1:22:29) SPEAKER_01: Anybody in the building could be injured by that.
(1:22:33) SPEAKER_01: And every ways I look, it's a roadblock.
(1:22:36) SPEAKER_01: I'm an attorney.
(1:22:37) SPEAKER_01: I'm 76.
(1:22:38) SPEAKER_01: I'm in my 50th year of practice.
(1:22:41) SPEAKER_01: I should be able to figure this out.
(1:22:43) SPEAKER_01: Half of my practice is in Department 501, the Housing Court and Real Property Department.
(1:22:49) SPEAKER_01: But I can't get anything done that protects my tenants.
(1:22:54) SPEAKER_01: And I have a moral and a legal obligation, and I wish you would do something, fund the police department for the missing 400 officers, take a look at who's getting by these.
(1:23:07) SPEAKER_01: This man has
(1:23:09) SPEAKER_01: 21 civil actions and five more under another name and 18 civil restraining orders.
(1:23:16) SPEAKER_01: How does that get slipping through the system?
(1:23:19) SPEAKER_01: I hope you'll take a look at it.
(1:23:20) SPEAKER_01: It won't solve my problem, but it'll solve somebody else's.
(1:23:24) SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
(1:23:26) SPEAKER_08: Next speaker, please.
(1:23:30) SPEAKER_02: Good afternoon, supervisors.
(1:23:31) SPEAKER_02: My name is Mark Solomon.
(1:23:32) SPEAKER_02: I've lived in what was to become the Native Cultural District for 35 years in the North Mission.
(1:23:37) SPEAKER_02: I co-founded the Community Land Trust, served on the MTA Citizen Advisory Committee, wrote the resolution that led to the Harvey Milk Memorial being in place here, and was a member of the Plaza 16 Coalition 10 years ago as a volunteer.
(1:23:47) SPEAKER_02: Our neighborhood has a history.
(1:23:49) SPEAKER_02: Mission Neighborhood Center 20 years ago was welcomed in as a homeless center.
(1:23:52) SPEAKER_02: It has turned the Hunter Block of Cap Street into crap.
(1:23:55) SPEAKER_02: Govio went ahead and cited itself at 15th and Julian.
(1:23:58) SPEAKER_02: It has turned that intersection into crap.
(1:24:00) SPEAKER_02: With that record, we opposed Mission Cabins.
(1:24:03) SPEAKER_02: Once Mission Cabins was cited at 1979 Mission, the fentanyl influx happened and gunfire rang out.
(1:24:08) SPEAKER_02: We were correct on that.
(1:24:11) SPEAKER_02: None of this happened before these facilities were opened.
(1:24:13) SPEAKER_02: So when we add new facilities, we bring things to neighborhoods.
(1:24:16) SPEAKER_02: The city's solution to this is for META and Mission Housing to decide to cite permanent supportive housing, PSH for homeless people, adjacent to the Marshall Elementary School.
(1:24:25) Unknown: Thank you. Thank you.
(1:24:26) SPEAKER_02: We're talking about nonprofit salaries.
(1:24:28) SPEAKER_02: At MEDA, Luis Granados made $366,000 in 2023.
(1:24:33) SPEAKER_02: Sam Moss made $275,000 at Mission Housing.
(1:24:37) SPEAKER_02: Moss is a yinbi.
(1:24:39) SPEAKER_02: These yinbis attacked martial parents, they attacked nonprofits, and they attacked residents as nimbis even after we fought for affordable housing at 1979 Mission because we don't want addicts and psych cases to be cited next to a vulnerable elementary school that has a high preponderance of homeless kids,
(1:24:56) SPEAKER_02: of immigrant kids, of kids of color, and of low-income kids.
(1:25:00) SPEAKER_02: What's next?
(1:25:00) SPEAKER_02: An ICE substation of the neighborhood to help out our partners?
(1:25:03) SPEAKER_02: We've asked Supervisor Fielder for help.
(1:25:04) SPEAKER_02: She's not contacted us.
(1:25:06) SPEAKER_02: Jackie Fielder, will you commit right here and right now to facilitate mediation between Marshall parents, residents, and nonprofits so we can meet with Mission Housing and MEDA to find an amicable solution for the affordable housing for homeless families that our neighborhood really needs?
(1:25:21) SPEAKER_02: Will you?
(1:25:22) SPEAKER_02: Do the chair?
(1:25:25) SPEAKER_07: Sir, if you could address the whole board.
(1:25:27) SPEAKER_08: Thank you so much.
(1:25:37) SPEAKER_08: Next speaker, please.
(1:25:38) SPEAKER_08: You have two minutes.
(1:25:46) SPEAKER_03: My name is Richard S.T.
(1:25:48) SPEAKER_03: Peterson.
(1:25:49) SPEAKER_03: Welcome, Board of Supervisors and President Mandelman.
(1:25:56) SPEAKER_03: And I have to echo a lot of the policies against roommates that are going on.
(1:26:03) SPEAKER_03: It cost me, as a lawyer, when I was actually practicing law, over $10,000 to remove a roommate that was only
(1:26:14) SPEAKER_03: And was a friend that I was only charging $400 a month to live in a No Way Valley bedroom apartment.
(1:26:23) SPEAKER_03: Well, it's not apartment, my cottage.
(1:26:26) SPEAKER_03: So I sympathize.
(1:26:27) SPEAKER_03: But the message for today, I think, is compromise.
(1:26:33) SPEAKER_03: We've got to figure out something to compromise.
(1:26:37) SPEAKER_03: There is resistance going on.
(1:26:40) SPEAKER_03: understandable, and you have to have strong resistance to be able to make a rational compromise.
(1:26:49) SPEAKER_03: And that is the word that I would like to leave you with today.
(1:26:54) SPEAKER_03: It's not defiance.
(1:26:56) SPEAKER_03: If you defy certain things, certain very bad things are going to happen.
(1:27:03) SPEAKER_03: I'm a
(1:27:07) SPEAKER_03: I'm an atheist and I'm classified with the communists, the socialists, and the terrorists in the group of four.
(1:27:19) SPEAKER_03: And so I can see that if you can't
(1:27:24) SPEAKER_03: reach some kind of compromise, which I understand that I do think that the mayor is trying to do.
(1:27:32) SPEAKER_03: We're going to be lost.
(1:27:34) SPEAKER_03: Anyway, I want to keep wearing one purple for a shout out for the Valkyries and a shout out to Mimi Haas.

Leah McGeever criticized local supervisors for not adequately supporting the transgender community and questioned San Francisco's commitment to being a sanctuary city for trans and immigrant residents. A longtime renter spoke about feeling unsafe due to an unauthorized occupant terrorizing tenants in their building, despite obtaining restraining orders and calling police. Stephanie's mother, who owns the building, described her nine-month legal process to remove the problematic individual and requested the city address gaps in housing policies. Mark Solomon opposed new supportive housing facilities near Marshall Elementary School due to concerns about drug use and safety, citing issues with previous facilities in the Mission district, and asked Supervisor Fielder to facilitate mediation. Richard Peterson emphasized the need for compromise on roommate-related policies and expressed support for the mayor's efforts. Capiriccio Flores requested that Playland and a bathhouse be restored at Ocean Beach. Public comment concluded with no further speakers.

(0:17:56) SPEAKER_03: Colleagues, I am today announcing a legislative drafting request to establish the San Francisco Hate Crime Reward Fund, which would authorize the chief of police in coordination with the district attorney to offer informants a reward of up to $100,000
(0:18:12) SPEAKER_03: for information leading to the conviction of a hate crime perpetrator.
(0:18:16) SPEAKER_03: This proposal comes after a spate of high profile incidents over the last year that have been investigated and in some cases prosecuted as hate crimes in San Francisco.
(0:18:26) SPEAKER_03: Early in my career, I worked with then District Attorney Arlo Smith to establish the DA's Hate Crimes Task Force, which developed policies and protocols for prosecuting these crimes at a time when California had only just enacted its hate crime statute.
(0:18:41) SPEAKER_03: Much later in my career, I worked as a civilian member of the police department command staff, a two-year stint during COVID-19, in which San Francisco witnessed a six-fold increase in hate crimes directed against our AAPI community.
(0:18:58) SPEAKER_03: Hate crimes are defined by a bias motivation that enhances the seriousness of existing crimes, which can range from graffiti vandalism to serious and even violent felonies up to and including homicides.
(0:19:10) SPEAKER_03: So I think it's important that our Hate Crime Reward Fund offer flexibility of up to $100,000 to account for the wide range of possibly applicable crimes.
(0:19:20) SPEAKER_03: One feature of hate crimes that's important to recognize is that it is rarely the aim of a perpetrator to victimize any one individual or business solely, but rather to instill fear in entire communities.
(0:19:34) SPEAKER_03: We have seen that in many communities here in San Francisco over the last year.
(0:19:38) SPEAKER_03: a Jewish business and anti-Semitic attack in recent weeks, still another attack on an AAPI senior last month, threats against our trans community and LGBTQ plus community more generally, and anti-Muslim vandalism and harassment at local mosques last year.
(0:19:55) SPEAKER_03: As a city enriched as ours is by its diversity and committed to pluralism as San Francisco is, we should lead on these issues.
(0:20:04) SPEAKER_03: In my view, a generously funded hate crime reward fund will help to flip the script on lawless bigots by instilling fear into hate criminals that informants will be well paid to bring them to justice for their hateful vandalism and violence.
(0:20:18) SPEAKER_03: especially in times like these.
(0:20:20) SPEAKER_03: It's vital that we take these attacks seriously.
(0:20:25) SPEAKER_03: This reward fund that I'm proposing will send a strong message to would-be hate criminals in San Francisco that our city is doing exactly that.
(0:20:33) SPEAKER_03: I want to thank controller Greg Wagner and his office with whom I'm working on options for structuring and funding this fund, which may expand on SFPD's existing reward fund, which is right now limited to homicide cases.
(0:20:45) SPEAKER_03: In either case, it would be an SFPD funded
(0:20:49) SPEAKER_03: Fund and the legislation would ensure that it's open to philanthropic support.
(0:20:54) SPEAKER_03: I also want to thank my early co-sponsors, Supervisors Cheryl, Sotter, Makmoud, and Gardeo, and Chen.
(0:21:00) SPEAKER_03: As always, I welcome the opportunity to collaborate with others as this legislation moves forward and the rest I submit.
(0:21:07) SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Supervisor Dorsey, Supervisor and Gardeo.

(0:21:18) SPEAKER_02: I have a brief introduction colleagues today.
(0:21:21) SPEAKER_02: I'm introducing legislation that builds on our city's all electric new construction ordinance, which the board passed in November of 2020.
(0:21:29) SPEAKER_02: That ordinance generally prohibits new construction projects from installing gas piping and appliances with specified exceptions.
(0:21:35) SPEAKER_02: The legislation I'm introducing today will expand the all electric ordinance to now include major renovations.
(0:21:40) SPEAKER_02: That is alterations in addition to existing buildings that include substantial upgrades to mechanical systems and structures.
(0:21:47) SPEAKER_02: I want to thank Supervisors Mahmoud and Fielder for their early co-sponsorship.
(0:21:53) SPEAKER_02: And I want to thank Time Rown Jew, Charles Sheehan, Cindy Cumberford, Barry Hooper, Joseph Piasecki, and Alice Her for mess of environment, for all of their work, as well as Rob Kaplow from the city attorney's office, and Calvin Ho and Brad Phelps from my office, and the rest I submit.
(0:22:11) SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Mr. President, Supervisor Melgar.
(0:22:13) SPEAKER_00: Submit, thank you, and Supervisor Sodder.
(0:22:20) SPEAKER_01: do legislation alongside Mayor Lurie to advance the 530 Sansom Project, a major downtown development that will bring countless neighborhood benefits.
(0:22:30) SPEAKER_01: This represents the most ambitious new development in the northern part of downtown in decades.
(0:22:36) SPEAKER_01: A 41-story tower will rise, comprising mixed uses across hotel, office, restaurant, and retail.
(0:22:43) SPEAKER_01: And when completed, it will generate more than $800 million in annual economic activity.
(0:22:49) SPEAKER_01: This project makes it clear that our downtown recovery is real and quickly accelerating, but I'm also excited about this project for all the neighborhood benefits it will bring about.
(0:22:59) SPEAKER_01: First, it will deliver a new state-of-the-art Fire Station 13 to support our fire department as they serve parts of Chinatown, Financial District, Embarcadero, Barbary Coast, Telegraph Hill, and Jackson Square.
(0:23:13) SPEAKER_01: Additionally, the project will generate nearly $15 million in affordable housing contributions to the city to support the creation of 100% affordable senior housing at 772 Pacific Avenue in Chinatown or other developments within District 3.
(0:23:30) SPEAKER_01: And this is money we will see quickly with an initial $2 million paid within six months of the entitlement.
(0:23:37) SPEAKER_01: And finally, as we face real fiscal challenges, we should be excited about the $14 million in annual general fund revenue that this project will contribute.
(0:23:46) SPEAKER_01: And this should be a reminder that we can meet our budget challenges through growth as well as through savings.
(0:23:52) SPEAKER_01: I also want to recognize the heavy lifting that my predecessor, Aaron Peskin, did over the past decade to move this project forward from a vision to now being on the cusp of groundbreaking.
(0:24:02) SPEAKER_01: The Board of Supervisors, including many of my current colleagues, endorsed this project in a resolution passed in November 2024 with an 11 to 0 vote.
(0:24:12) SPEAKER_01: This project also has widespread support from labor who recognize the tremendous number of good-paying jobs that will go into the construction and maintenance of this project.
(0:24:21) SPEAKER_01: I'm very happy to see this project moving forward in my district.
(0:24:24) SPEAKER_01: After a planning commission hearing in July, I look forward to this legislation coming to the board for consideration later in the summer.
(0:24:31) SPEAKER_01: I hope it will earn your support so that we can get shovels in the ground, a new fire station built, and affordable housing funds distributed, and the rest I submit.
(0:24:40) SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Supervisor Sotter.
(0:24:42) SPEAKER_00: Mr. President.
(0:24:45) SPEAKER_02: Thank you, Madam Clerk.
(0:24:45) SPEAKER_02: Let's go to our 2.30 p.m.
(0:24:47) SPEAKER_02: special order, recognition of commendations.
(0:24:50) SPEAKER_00: It's now time","Supervisor Dorsey announced a legislative drafting request to create the San Francisco Hate Crime Reward Fund, which would allow the police chief and district attorney to offer rewards up to $100,000 for information leading to the conviction of hate crime perpetrators. This initiative responds to a rise in hate crimes targeting various communities, including recent incidents affecting the AAPI, Jewish, LGBTQ+, and Muslim communities. The fund aims to instill fear in potential hate criminals and may expand the existing SFPD reward program, currently limited to homicide cases. Supervisors Chen, Mandelman, Makmoud, and others expressed support and co-sponsorship.

Supervisor Melgar introduced legislation to extend the city's all-electric new construction ordinance, passed in 2020, to also cover major renovations. This update would prevent gas piping and appliance installations in substantial building alterations, aligning with environmental goals. Supervisor Sotter highlighted the 530 Sansom Project, a large mixed-use development in downtown San Francisco that includes a new fire station, affordable housing contributions, and significant economic and general fund revenue benefits. The project, supported by Mayor Lurie and labor unions, is progressing toward construction following planning commission approval, with the legislation expected to reach the board for a vote later in the summer. The session concluded with a transition to special orders and commendations.",{}

(0:25:19) SPEAKER_02: to commend Harry, bro.
(0:25:21) SPEAKER_02: Harry, would you please come join us up here?
(0:25:32) SPEAKER_02: Harry, for those of you who have not had the pleasure to meet him, is an extraordinary San Franciscan whose life has been defined by resilience, by creativity, by service, and most of all by compassion.
(0:25:45) SPEAKER_02: Harry moved to San Francisco in 1970, currently lives in Cathedral Hill, and he is District 2's representative on the Department of Disability and Aging Services Advisory Council.
(0:25:55) SPEAKER_02: Born and raised in a small town of Louisiana, quite close to where many of my family comes from, Harry brought with him a quiet strength and a fierce sense of justice that would come to define his role in San Francisco's LGBTQ plus community.
(0:26:09) SPEAKER_02: After testing positive for HIV in the early 1980s, during the harrowing early years of the AIDS epidemic,
(0:26:15) SPEAKER_02: Harry threw himself into the volunteering community as a powerful advocate and friend for others navigating the long road of survival.
(0:26:24) SPEAKER_02: Since then, Harry has volunteered with the Shanti Project, the SF AIDS Foundation, the Senior in Disability Action, and many, many more, helping provide emotional and practical support to our disabled residents as well as AIDS survivors.
(0:26:38) SPEAKER_02: Harry's not just a witness to history, but he's a shaper of it, showing up for his community as an activist and an artist.
(0:26:46) SPEAKER_02: He is dedicated to carrying on the memory of the friends he lost in the epidemic, sharing their stories to ensure they are never forgotten.
(0:26:54) SPEAKER_02: And if you know Harry, you know that he does all this with remarkable humility.
(0:26:59) SPEAKER_02: Most recently, he spearheaded the creation of the large-scale Pride Flag mural at the Jane Warner Plaza in the Castro, a vibrant and lasting tribute to the LGBTQ plus community's visibility and resilience.
(0:27:10) SPEAKER_02: As our representative on the DAS Advisory Council, he continues to lift up the voices of community members who are too often overlooked.
(0:27:18) SPEAKER_02: Whether it's mentoring others, advocating for services, or marching down Market Street, dressed in full Rocky horror for pride, Harry embodies what it means to live boldly and give back.
(0:27:29) SPEAKER_02: His story reminds us that pride is not only about celebration.
(0:27:32) SPEAKER_02: It's about remembrance, visibility, and honoring those who paved the way.
(0:27:38) SPEAKER_02: We're grateful today.
(0:27:40) SPEAKER_02: And I am always grateful for Harry, bro, and for his lifetime of service, strength, and spirit.
(0:27:46) SPEAKER_02: And we are incredibly proud to celebrate him this Pride Month.
(0:27:51) SPEAKER_02: But for me personally, Harry is a constant reminder that success and passion and a life of commitment to friends is not always a linear journey.
(0:28:05) SPEAKER_02: You are an inspiring reminder to me personally that sometimes we may fall
(0:28:10) SPEAKER_02: And sometimes we may doubt, but that only gives us more strength.
(0:28:15) SPEAKER_02: And that success in a better life only comes through some hardship.
(0:28:20) SPEAKER_02: And every down is just a weight on the step towards more ups.
(0:28:25) SPEAKER_02: And you personally have inspired me to keep pushing forward, as I know you've inspired so many others.
(0:28:32) SPEAKER_02: So Harry, I want to thank you, quite frankly, for being you.
(0:28:36) SPEAKER_02: I'm so grateful to know you just a little bit that I do.
(0:28:40) SPEAKER_02: And I know that my thanks is shown by so many others here in San Francisco.
(0:28:49) SPEAKER_02: Harry, thank you.
(0:29:03) SPEAKER_07: I want to thank you.
(0:29:05) SPEAKER_07: It's a very moving thing to be honored.
(0:29:08) SPEAKER_07: And I want to thank San Francisco for what it's given me in the last 50, 60 years.
(0:29:16) SPEAKER_07: And I also want to point out that we're under what I consider to be duress in this country right now for the LGBT community.
(0:29:26) SPEAKER_07: And I want to
(0:29:28) SPEAKER_07: be grateful for anything that this board can do to continue to support the LGBT community in this city and in the world by our example.
(0:29:41) SPEAKER_07: I'm very grateful, and I wasn't prepared to make any speech, so I'm kind of fumbling, but San Francisco is the beacon in this country
(0:29:55) SPEAKER_07: for treating people the way they should be treated, for treating each other with humility and compassion and sympathy and empathy.
(0:30:06) SPEAKER_07: And if we don't continue to do that, the country is going to suffer because I know from the way that I put that mural in Jane Warner Plaza, primarily because it is on a worldwide web,
(0:30:22) SPEAKER_07: camera that can be seen 24-7 and deliver the message that the Castro and San Francisco is open to all people, no matter what their gender or their needs or any of the rest of it.
(0:30:36) SPEAKER_07: Anybody can come to San Francisco and be cared for as a human being and treated well.
(0:30:43) SPEAKER_07: and I hope that that continues long after I'm no longer around, which being 80 years old, there is a limit and I realize it.
(0:30:52) SPEAKER_07: So for the rest of my time, I will be fighting for those principles that San Francisco and the city that's named for St.
(0:31:01) SPEAKER_07: Francis will engender.
(0:31:04) SPEAKER_07: Thank you all for your support in that and your continued work toward those goals.
(0:31:39) SPEAKER_03: District 5 Supervisor Mahmoud.
(0:31:45) SPEAKER_05: Can we have Minister Marvin White to come to the podium?
(0:31:56) SPEAKER_05: Colleagues, today I have the profound honor of recognizing a visionary artist, spiritual leader, and truth teller whose work has reshaped how we understand faith, justice, and joy here in San Francisco.
(0:32:12) SPEAKER_05: We are here to celebrate Minister Marvin K. White, the Minister of Celebration at Glide Memorial Church.
(0:32:27) SPEAKER_05: whose ministry is as rooted in poetry as it is in prophetic power, and whose leadership speaks not just to the soul of a congregation, but to the soul of our city.
(0:32:38) SPEAKER_05: He's a public theologian, a preacher, and a poet who brings people together across perceived boundaries of race, sexuality, gender, faith, and identity.
(0:32:50) SPEAKER_05: And it invites us into a more loving, liberated, and unified future.
(0:32:55) SPEAKER_05: When I first asked around about Minister Marvin, I expected to hear about his work at Glide, his sermons or his art.
(0:33:01) SPEAKER_05: And I did.
(0:33:02) SPEAKER_05: But what I heard most clearly over and over again was more importantly how he makes people feel.
(0:33:11) SPEAKER_05: People said he gives me permission to feel joy again.
(0:33:15) SPEAKER_05: He helps us grieve honestly and celebrate fiercely.
(0:33:20) SPEAKER_05: He reminds us that God is not done with us yet.
(0:33:26) SPEAKER_05: Whether on the stage, behind a pulpit, or holding space for healing, Minister Marvin brings people into a deeper relationship with themselves, with one another, and with a higher calling towards justice.
(0:33:40) SPEAKER_05: Minister Marvin earned his Master of Divinity from the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley.
(0:33:45) SPEAKER_05: I will not hold it against you as someone from the other school.
(0:33:49) SPEAKER_05: And he's never stopped creating sense.
(0:33:54) SPEAKER_05: He is the author of four books of poetry, including Our Name, Be Witness, Status, and Two Lambda, literary award-nominated collections, Last Rights, and Nothing Ugly Fly.
(0:34:06) SPEAKER_05: His words have been performed on stages across the country and adapted for screen, and he himself has toured nationally and internationally as a member of the groundbreaking performance collective, Pomo Afrohomos, one of the earliest group-centering queer black narratives on stage.
(0:34:23) SPEAKER_05: He has led writing workshops in classrooms, prisons, and churches.
(0:34:28) SPEAKER_05: He is a Cave Canem Fellow, and he helped found two vital spaces for queer and BIPOC writers, Fire and Ink and Be Glam.
(0:34:37) SPEAKER_05: In 2019, he was named one of the YBCA 100 for his cultural and community impact.
(0:34:44) SPEAKER_05: But his artistry is not separate from his ministry.
(0:34:48) SPEAKER_05: At Glide and throughout his life, he has used storytelling as salvation and imagination as resistance.
(0:34:56) SPEAKER_05: When Reverend Cecil Williams selected Minister Marvin to serve Glide, he didn't just choose the successor, he chose a path forward.
(0:35:04) SPEAKER_05: Minister Marvin leads with celebration, but he's not afraid of grief.
(0:35:09) SPEAKER_05: He leads with laughter, but he does not ignore pain.
(0:35:13) SPEAKER_05: And above all, he leads with love, radical, inclusive, embodied love.
(0:35:19) SPEAKER_05: In a world where so many queer and trans people have been told that faith does not belong to them, Minister Marvin has rewritten that script.
(0:35:29) SPEAKER_05: He has reminded us that the divine can be found in a poem, in a protest, and in each other.
(0:35:35) SPEAKER_05: His leadership during Pride Month and Juneteenth is not incidental.
(0:35:39) SPEAKER_05: It is essential.
(0:35:41) SPEAKER_05: He shows us what liberation can look like when rooted in history, acceptance, and looking forward.
(0:35:48) SPEAKER_05: Mr. Marvin is what we in District 5 call a light, and what we in the Tenderloin as a resident call a light as well.
(0:35:55) SPEAKER_05: Not a spotlight, but a lantern.
(0:35:58) SPEAKER_05: Something you can carry with you, something that helps you see more clearly, and something that calls you home.
(0:36:05) SPEAKER_05: He is part of a lineage of black queer faith leaders who have redefined what the church can be, not just as a sanctuary, but a stage, a school, and a site of resistance.
(0:36:16) SPEAKER_05: He's not only building a spiritual legacy, he's building a space for healing, for art, for presence, and for endless possibility.
(0:36:25) SPEAKER_05: So colleagues, please join me in recognizing Minister Marvin K. White for his visionary leadership.
(0:37:01) SPEAKER_05: The board never gets that applause.
(0:37:06) SPEAKER_05: Unapologetic joy, his enduring ministry, and his ability to see holiness in places the world too often overlooks.
(0:37:13) SPEAKER_05: Minister Marvin, thank you for showing us that celebration can be sacred, that poetry can be prophetic, and that community can be a church.
(0:37:20) SPEAKER_05: On behalf of the people of District 5, the Tenderloin, and the city and county of San Francisco, we are proud to honor you today.
(0:37:35) SPEAKER_11: You guys will appreciate this.
(0:37:36) SPEAKER_11: There's a two minute time clock right here.
(0:37:38) SPEAKER_11: And I'm a black gay preacher.
(0:37:43) SPEAKER_11: Thank you.
(0:37:44) SPEAKER_11: It is an honor and a privilege to be a resident of district five to work in district five to know these streets of the tenderloin Intimately to walk them every day three times a day with my hundred and fifty pound dog And to know that there is ministry in the tenderloin just by walking amongst the people and learning to find the beauty of
(0:38:09) SPEAKER_11: and to know your way home by the people, whether they're posted on the corner or standing in line for food at Glide.
(0:38:17) SPEAKER_11: It is an honor to be here at this point in my life.
(0:38:20) SPEAKER_09: Mr. White, can you please speak directly into the microphone so we can best hear you?
(0:38:24) SPEAKER_09: Yes, ma'am.
(0:38:25) SPEAKER_09: Thank you.
(0:38:27) SPEAKER_11: Thank you.
(0:38:28) SPEAKER_11: Thank you.
(0:38:29) SPEAKER_11: I want to say that I stand here in the long shadow of the late great Reverend Cisa Williams.
(0:38:40) SPEAKER_11: and Janice Mirkatani, former poet laureate, but also in the new day of our new president and CEO, Dr. Gina Fromer.
(0:38:51) SPEAKER_11: It's an amazing thing to be able to walk from Cecil and then walk with Dr. Fromer towards this new legacy and this new vision of glide.
(0:39:00) SPEAKER_11: I think my proudest moment is, yes, this award, but also that people look at me and go, him?
(0:39:08) SPEAKER_11: You mean he gets to?
(0:39:10) SPEAKER_11: You mean that same one that was, and I've seen black gay men become activists and leaders.
(0:39:19) SPEAKER_11: I've seen senior women become leaders and advocates.
(0:39:23) SPEAKER_11: I've seen queer people become artists only because they've seen me and they know that it's possible that we can start wherever we are.
(0:39:32) SPEAKER_11: So I am honored.
(0:39:36) SPEAKER_11: I am honored to live in a city and in a place where what your life experience is can determine what you can give to the city.
(0:39:43) SPEAKER_11: It doesn't exempt you or exclude you from anything.
(0:39:46) SPEAKER_11: It is the place where you start your ministry and your activism and your artistry.
(0:39:51) SPEAKER_11: So thank you so much to my friends and families and colleagues and my community as well.
(0:39:57) SPEAKER_11: I love serving and working alongside you all.
(0:39:59) SPEAKER_11: Thank you again, Supervisor, for this honor.
(0:40:46) SPEAKER_04: District 6 Supervisor Dorsey Thank You President Mandelman colleagues As we celebrate leaders from our LGBTQ plus community for Pride Month It is my distinct honor to recognize James Jim Haas Come on up to the lectern
(0:41:10) SPEAKER_04: Now, Jim is a longtime District 6 resident whose legacy isn't limited to the cause of LGBTQ plus equality that he has championed for more than 50 years.
(0:41:20) SPEAKER_04: In fact, his legacy includes a city that is more beautiful, more walkable, more livable, and in every respect, truer to its rich heritage and storied history, thanks in large part to his urbanist vision and activism that was often years ahead of his time.
(0:41:37) SPEAKER_04: Jim Haas is a fifth generation San Franciscan, whose contributions to our city and its LGBTQ plus community spans decades.
(0:41:46) SPEAKER_04: After graduating from Stanford in 1964 in Columbia Law School in 1969, Jim practiced law until his retirement in 2010, specializing in real estate and land use.
(0:41:58) SPEAKER_04: Beyond his legal career, however, it is Jim's LGBTQ plus advocacy and extraordinary public service we celebrate today.
(0:42:05) SPEAKER_04: In 1983, Jim began hosting meetings in his kitchen, small gatherings that would spark historic progress toward LGBTQ plus inclusion.
(0:42:14) SPEAKER_04: From those meetings came the Bay Area Nonpartisan Alliance, San Francisco's first LGBTQ plus political action committee.
(0:42:23) SPEAKER_04: It would raise and distribute funds to support many candidates and causes, and it would eventually be folded into California's first statewide LGBTQ plus pack to broaden its mission.
(0:42:33) SPEAKER_04: Jim helped lay the foundation for generations of LGBTQ plus political engagement and representation, working among others with the late Jim Rivaldo, whom I consider a friend and mentor.
(0:42:45) SPEAKER_04: In 2004, during San Francisco's historic winter of love, Jim served as a volunteer marriage counselor, officiating weddings for 30 couples.
(0:42:54) SPEAKER_04: It was a moment of joy and courage in our city's long march toward equality, and Jim helped make it real one ceremony at a time.
(0:43:01) SPEAKER_04: But Jim Civic Impact reaches far beyond LGBTQ plus issues alone.
(0:43:07) SPEAKER_04: At his urging, then-supervisor Jack Molinari, with the endorsement of then-supervisor Harvey Milk, who sat at this very desk,
(0:43:16) SPEAKER_04: introduced the ballot measure in the late 1970s to create our elected charter commission.
(0:43:21) SPEAKER_04: That measure passed.
(0:43:22) SPEAKER_04: Jim was elected a commissioner, and although it took another decade and a half, that commission's draft eventually became the basis for San Francisco's modern city charter of 1996.
(0:43:33) SPEAKER_04: Jim would go on to chair the Citizens Transportation Committee in the 1980s, helping to pass tax measures that funded key transportation improvements, and that would create the San Francisco County Transportation Agency.
(0:43:45) SPEAKER_04: He also led the Embarcadero Freeway Citizens Committee, which successfully battled a multitude of powerful interests to finally tear down the Embarcadero Freeway, a civic eyesore that for 30 years blocked access to our cherished waterfront
(0:44:01) SPEAKER_04: and that was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
(0:44:05) SPEAKER_04: Now today, most people have either forgotten or maybe never knew how Herculean, a political task, it was to remove that freeway.
(0:44:15) SPEAKER_04: Voters had soundly rejected a 1986 ballot measure by a two to one margin to tear it down, and that it finally happened is testament to Jim's leadership and persistence.
(0:44:26) SPEAKER_04: Jim has also been a tireless advocate for our Civic Center, fighting for improvements there for more than two decades from supporting the campaign for a new main library to helping restore City Hall to organizing the mayor's first Civic Center stakeholders meeting.
(0:44:42) SPEAKER_04: In 2019, Jim published the San Francisco Civic Center.
(0:44:48) SPEAKER_04: A deeply researched book that captures the history and meaning of one of our city's most iconic spaces.
(0:44:54) SPEAKER_04: It is available on Amazon and Kindle.
(0:44:58) SPEAKER_04: This is required reading for anyone who wants to understand the historic heart of San Francisco and to gain insights from this as a blueprint to fulfill the promise of civic center for generations to come.
(0:45:10) SPEAKER_04: Today, Jim remains a thoughtful contributor to our civic conversations and influential urbanist, a valued member of the District 6 office's unofficial brain trust, and whether it's advocating for cleaner streets, public safety, or simply offering a well-timed bit of wisdom, Jim leads by example.
(0:45:29) SPEAKER_04: During Pride Month, as we honor those who've paved the way for LGBTQ plus rights and representation, it is especially fitting that we recognize Jim Haas, not just for what he has done, but for how he has done it with integrity, with purpose, and with a lifelong commitment to the city he loves and calls home.
(0:45:47) SPEAKER_04: Jim, on behalf of a grateful board of supervisors, a grateful LGBTQ plus community, and a grateful city.
(0:45:53) SPEAKER_04: We thank you for your lifetime of service and your effective advocacy.
(0:45:57) SPEAKER_04: We proudly celebrate you today.
(0:46:07) SPEAKER_01: Supervisors, I'm humbled by Supervisor Dorsey's choosing me
(0:46:12) SPEAKER_01: for this honor.
(0:46:14) SPEAKER_01: Yes, I've been around for a long time, and I have roots to go even further.
(0:46:19) SPEAKER_01: I think that made me feel particularly obliged to invest my spare time and energy into the city.
(0:46:29) SPEAKER_01: I don't know if any of you remember that I think it was the Kaiser Cement Company had an ad that said, find a need and fill it.
(0:46:37) SPEAKER_01: And that's sort of what I did.
(0:46:38) SPEAKER_01: I took on tasks that needed to be done.
(0:46:41) SPEAKER_01: Often nobody else was particularly interested in them.
(0:46:46) SPEAKER_01: And I got involved.
(0:46:50) SPEAKER_01: I have to say, as you've already seen, that many of these projects I got involved with
(0:46:56) SPEAKER_01: involved quite a bit of a conniving and other perhaps underhanded techniques to get them done.
(0:47:05) SPEAKER_01: But the goal was to get them done.
(0:47:10) SPEAKER_01: I guess I'm proud of two things, the work for the San Francisco
(0:47:16) SPEAKER_01: Committee the sales tax and that was sort of a free-floating committee.
(0:47:22) SPEAKER_01: Mayor Agnus wasn't particularly interested in it.
(0:47:24) SPEAKER_01: The supervisors hadn't at that time had a little idea what it was all about.
(0:47:29) SPEAKER_01: And there was a period of time when Mayor Agnus wasn't even talking to me.
(0:47:35) SPEAKER_01: But we got it passed, and by 55%, those were in the days when you could get things passed by 55%.
(0:47:41) SPEAKER_01: And I've never asked, but I suspect that the sales tax and the related activities of the San Francisco
(0:47:50) SPEAKER_01: County Transportation Authority has generated several billions of dollars investment in transportation in the city.
(0:47:58) SPEAKER_01: And of course, you all, the members of the Board of Supervisors who are the commissioners, get to go to monthly meetings and you get your $150 stipend as well.
(0:48:10) SPEAKER_01: The other thing is my work at Civic Center, first with the library, and writing that book was a great achievement for me.
(0:48:21) SPEAKER_01: There was a rumor spread by the
(0:48:25) SPEAKER_01: a work colleague of mine that I couldn't write anything.
(0:48:29) SPEAKER_01: And of course, the book came out.
(0:48:33) SPEAKER_01: It was published by the University of Nevada Press, and I had the good fortune of having the great California historian Kevin Starr
(0:48:42) SPEAKER_01: Guiding me and urging me on to get it done But it is kind of the template of where we are and what why this is important and Because I found that before that people had no idea what this was all about and why it came about and what it significance was and I'm now 83 and I'm not
(0:49:03) SPEAKER_01: quite done yet, there's more things to do to complete and improve Civic Center.
(0:49:09) SPEAKER_01: And I hope I have several more years to see that.
(0:49:14) SPEAKER_01: So I thank you for this honor and the opportunity to reveal my life's activities in the public realm before the public.
(0:50:12) SPEAKER_03: District 9 Supervisor Fielder.
(0:50:34) SPEAKER_00: Thanks, President Mandelman.
(0:50:36) SPEAKER_00: I'd like to welcome up to the podium Malia Español and the whole crew at Mother Bar.
(0:50:43) SPEAKER_00: Please come by.
(0:50:51) SPEAKER_00: I am so honored to recognize Mother Bar today, a lesbian and queer bar in the heart of the mission on 16th Street.
(0:50:59) SPEAKER_00: Mother is more than just a bar.
(0:51:02) SPEAKER_00: It's a sanctuary where all identities are embraced and celebrated.
(0:51:06) SPEAKER_00: It's a place where queer women find community, joy, and belonging.
(0:51:11) SPEAKER_00: Born from a vision to fill a long-standing gap in San Francisco's queer nightlife, Mother Bar has become a home base for queer women and femmes that have lacked a place that centered our experiences.
(0:51:24) SPEAKER_00: At the heart of Mother is Malia Español,
(0:51:27) SPEAKER_00: Malia has been shaping San Francisco cultural spaces for years from running beloved bars like Pops and the Parkside to opening up her own Muay Thai Gym.
(0:51:38) SPEAKER_00: Malia has created spaces where connections flourish.
(0:51:42) SPEAKER_00: With Mother, she created something really special.
(0:51:46) SPEAKER_00: She created a neighborhood bar where queer people feel safe, feel seen, and feel celebrated.
(0:51:52) SPEAKER_00: Mother keeps queer women's history alive whilst building something new.
(0:51:57) SPEAKER_00: It stands as a reminder that queer joy is vital, especially right now, and spaces like these are necessary to our survival.
(0:52:08) SPEAKER_00: Mother is helping shape the future of Queer San Francisco with every night it opens its doors.
(0:52:14) SPEAKER_00: It's more than just a place to party.
(0:52:16) SPEAKER_00: It's a sanctuary, a celebration, and a reminder of the power of chosen family.
(0:52:23) SPEAKER_00: To Malia and all the folks here, the entire mother team, I extend my deepest gratitude, especially as a queer woman of color.
(0:52:31) SPEAKER_00: Thank you for creating a space that feels like home, where joy, self-expression, and community flourish.
(0:52:39) SPEAKER_00: Your unwavering commitment to the LGBTQ community doesn't just inspire, it uplifts, and empowers us all.
(0:52:47) SPEAKER_00: And congratulations on all you've built and happy Pride.
(0:52:51) SPEAKER_00: Here's to so many more nights of magic, music, and love.
(0:53:04) SPEAKER_13: Hi.
(0:53:06) SPEAKER_13: Thank you.
(0:53:07) SPEAKER_13: Thank you for all you do.
(0:53:10) SPEAKER_13: I'm a little unprepared.
(0:53:13) SPEAKER_13: I came to the city 35 years ago, spent 25 in the Mission District, but in the 90s sort of the queer community was thriving and we had spaces and events and artists and, you know, we had
(0:53:28) SPEAKER_13: We had such a community and I've slowly seen that sort of disappear and coming out of COVID I looked around for community and could not find it.
(0:53:40) SPEAKER_13: And so in sort of a love letter or an offering to the community and to the youth of the city, I thought it was important to open the bar.
(0:53:51) SPEAKER_13: and I found these guys and you know I create the bones and they really are the like the heartbeat of the bar and thank you so much and thank you to all of you guys and let's just keep on providing the space for you know everyone in the city.
(0:54:35) SPEAKER_03: District One Supervisor Chan.
(0:54:38) SPEAKER_10: Thank you, President Mendelman.
(0:54:40) SPEAKER_10: Colleagues, it is truly a privilege to be able to invite and recognize Madeleine Lim, a celebrated filmmaker, producer, director, adjunct professor, and longtime LGBTQ activist, whose films have been screened at sold-out theaters, a film festival from across the world.
(0:55:01) SPEAKER_10: Her work has been embellished with numerous procedures and highly competitive awards.
(0:55:06) SPEAKER_10: That is too many to name.
(0:55:08) SPEAKER_10: Her work has also been featured at prominent local institutions, including Diyang and Asian Art Museum, and broadcasted to millions of audience on PBS.
(0:55:20) SPEAKER_10: Madeline's activism started in her early 20s.
(0:55:25) SPEAKER_10: She ran an underground lesbian feminist newsletter in Singapore for two years, and later became actively involved in the Association of Women for Action and Research.
(0:55:37) SPEAKER_10: an organization that advocates for gender equality and provides critical support services for women in Singapore.
(0:55:46) SPEAKER_10: In 1987, Madeleine co-wrote and directed a skit called the Myth Pageant Beauty Contest, a parody on the Myth Pageant Beauty Contest in celebration of International Women's Day.
(0:56:00) SPEAKER_10: Shortly after the event,
(0:56:02) SPEAKER_10: Her co-author was arrested by the Singapore government.
(0:56:08) SPEAKER_10: Madeline escaped persecution and eventually made her way to San Francisco.
(0:56:13) SPEAKER_10: Ten years later, she created the award-winning documentary Samba Balancan in San Francisco in 1997, a film that is still banned in Singapore for its exploration of race, sexuality, and nationality.
(0:56:31) SPEAKER_10: continuing to see a lack of broad representation for queer women of color.
(0:56:39) SPEAKER_10: Even in San Francisco, she co-founded Queer Women of Color Media Arts Project, QuackMap, a local organization that supports the creation
(0:56:52) SPEAKER_10: and distribution of films that address current social issue affecting LGBTQ plus women of color and their communities.
(0:57:03) SPEAKER_10: Queer Women of Color Media Arts Project provides training, screening opportunities, and resources to filmmakers so they can authentically reflect their life stories and build community through art and activism.
(0:57:19) SPEAKER_10: Particularly during this time when so many of our immigrant and LGBTQ plus community members are under attack by our own federal government.
(0:57:28) SPEAKER_10: I know that San Francisco must continue to amplify and make space for queer women of color to tell their stories and I am just so proud and that we get a chance to invite her to be here but to also say that
(0:57:46) SPEAKER_10: I think oftentimes, career women of color, definitely in Asia, really continue to be not only marginalized but also criminalized on so many levels, through so many layers, and their stories are not told, and oftentimes they're left behind.
(0:58:05) SPEAKER_10: But to have someone like Madeline Lim and willing to tell their stories,
(0:58:10) SPEAKER_10: and understand the risk to take that they must take and the filmmakers themselves as well.
(0:58:17) SPEAKER_10: And just to be able to create that safe space for them to tell that story is just amazing.
(0:58:22) SPEAKER_10: And for that, I'm just so grateful, not just for the queer woman of color right now, but really for the generations to come so that they, hopefully one day, maybe take this for granted to be able to say, yes, this is a safe space and this is their role and that they can be proudly
(0:58:39) SPEAKER_10: to be who they are, not just in the United States or San Francisco or California, but all around the globe.
(0:58:45) SPEAKER_10: And so thank you for your contribution.
(0:58:59) SPEAKER_06: Good afternoon, everyone.
(0:59:02) SPEAKER_06: Thank you so much to all of the supervisors, President Mendelman, and especially Connie Chan for this recognition.
(0:59:10) SPEAKER_06: I am deeply humbled and touched.
(0:59:13) SPEAKER_06: In the 70s, I was a queer teen coming of age, and I was pulled out of my classes by the school principal, being counseled to be straight, get a boyfriend, put on makeup.
(0:59:28) SPEAKER_06: I almost did not survive my coming out.
(0:59:33) SPEAKER_06: And as Supervisor Connie Chen mentioned, I escaped Singapore because I was doing underground LGBTQ organizing.
(0:59:42) SPEAKER_06: And it was getting dangerous.
(0:59:46) SPEAKER_06: I was in my early 20s and I did not, you know, who wants to
(0:59:50) SPEAKER_06: who envisions hanging out in jail, right?
(0:59:53) SPEAKER_06: I did not.
(0:59:54) SPEAKER_06: And I came to San Francisco.
(0:59:56) SPEAKER_06: It was my sanctuary.
(0:59:58) SPEAKER_06: San Francisco is a beacon for so many, for those of us who are LGBTQ, those of us who are immigrants and artists.
(1:00:09) SPEAKER_06: Filmmaking kicked my butt.
(1:00:12) SPEAKER_06: It was my calling.
(1:00:14) SPEAKER_06: I think I knew I was a filmmaker when I was deeply engaged in an argument.
(1:00:19) SPEAKER_06: I was 15.
(1:00:20) SPEAKER_06: My girlfriend was a year younger.
(1:00:21) SPEAKER_06: And, you know, those arguments at that age are life and death, literally.
(1:00:27) SPEAKER_06: And I remember stopping the argument for a second, thinking in my head, this might make an interesting film one day.
(1:00:36) SPEAKER_06: And then I went back to my argument.
(1:00:40) SPEAKER_06: I made a documentary called Samba Balachan in San Francisco through San Francisco State University's program.
(1:00:48) SPEAKER_06: It won several awards.
(1:00:50) SPEAKER_06: It toured International Film Festival for about two or three years at every film festival that I attended, whether it was LGBTQ Film Festival or People of Color Film Festival or Human Rights Film Festival.
(1:01:02) SPEAKER_06: I found myself among one handful of queer women of color filmmakers.
(1:01:08) SPEAKER_06: And it occurred to me, if we are not the ones telling our own stories, our own lives, our own communities, our own experiences, who will?
(1:01:20) SPEAKER_06: I knew as an independent filmmaker, I would make one film every three to five years because of the fundraising involved.
(1:01:27) SPEAKER_06: But I knew if I taught filmmaking,
(1:01:31) SPEAKER_06: I could teach an art form that is so expensive that has an economic barrier associated with it.
(1:01:41) SPEAKER_06: In one year, if I have 40 participants, in 10 years, I would have had 400 participants.
(1:01:48) SPEAKER_06: In 25 years, we have had over 500 films created by our queer women of color, non-binary transgender people of color communities.
(1:02:01) SPEAKER_06: 500 plus films, no other arts institution in the world has this collection of films about our community.
(1:02:11) SPEAKER_06: I was so not trying to start a nonprofit.
(1:02:14) SPEAKER_06: I was really trying to make change, and it happened to be through film and teaching.
(1:02:22) SPEAKER_06: We just presented our annual film festival.
(1:02:24) SPEAKER_06: It was our 21st Queer Women of Color Film Festival a couple of weeks ago at the Presidio Theater.
(1:02:30) SPEAKER_06: We had over 1,500 people come through the three days.
(1:02:33) SPEAKER_06: We screened over 49 films through seven screening programs.
(1:02:39) SPEAKER_06: It took us 20 years to grow our organizational budget to $500,000.
(1:02:43) SPEAKER_06: 20 years because racism, sexism, homophobia are blatant in fundraising.
(1:02:54) SPEAKER_06: Queer women of color are constantly perceived as a niche within a niche within a niche, when in fact we are really bridges.
(1:03:05) SPEAKER_06: When that happens, our lives are devalued, our work dismissed.
(1:03:13) SPEAKER_06: This year marks our 25th anniversary of our organization.
(1:03:17) SPEAKER_06: It's a huge milestone for us, however, in March.
(1:03:21) SPEAKER_06: Unfortunately, we had a grant, two grants actually, from the San Francisco Human Rights Commission canceled.
(1:03:28) SPEAKER_06: And $500,000 is half of our organizational budget.
(1:03:34) SPEAKER_06: It was not fair.
(1:03:35) SPEAKER_06: It was wrong.
(1:03:36) SPEAKER_06: It was unjust.
(1:03:38) SPEAKER_06: And unfortunately, there is no recourse.
(1:03:44) SPEAKER_06: It would have supported a second year of our Korean Trans Black Filmmakers Artist Fellowship Program.
(1:03:52) SPEAKER_06: No similar program exists in the entire country, except here in San Francisco at Kwakmap.
(1:03:59) SPEAKER_06: The second grant would have supported a queer and trans apprenticeship program.
(1:04:04) SPEAKER_06: It would, both grants would have developed workforce, would have been workforce development.
(1:04:11) SPEAKER_06: There were 38 organizations that got their grants canceled.
(1:04:15) SPEAKER_06: They were all people of color led organizations that served people of color communities.
(1:04:22) SPEAKER_06: So San Francisco is a beacon.
(1:04:26) SPEAKER_06: Shining brightly globally, this beacon is made up of hundreds of diverse multiple lights.
(1:04:36) SPEAKER_06: Lights that are our grassroots community-based nonprofit organizations that provide a much needed anchor, especially right now during this tumultuous, unpredictable stormy period.
(1:04:57) SPEAKER_06: Hundreds of local lights coming together to create this global beacon that we live and call home in San Francisco.
(1:05:09) SPEAKER_06: I implore you, support your local, anchor arts and culture organization.
(1:05:17) SPEAKER_06: QuackMap is queer-led, immigrant-led, people of color-led,
(1:05:24) SPEAKER_06: Protect the most vulnerable among us, because if we don't, who will?
(1:05:32) SPEAKER_06: We are celebrating pride.
(1:05:34) SPEAKER_06: To be honest, my heart is heavy.
(1:05:39) SPEAKER_06: This budget cuts have had an emotional, physical, mental impact toll on all of us.
(1:05:47) SPEAKER_06: We have been operating on reserves all year.
(1:05:49) SPEAKER_06: It's our 25th anniversary and I am afraid that our doors might not stay open after this year.
(1:06:00) SPEAKER_06: So thank you for this recognition.
(1:06:02) SPEAKER_06: It is much appreciated and happy pride everyone.
(1:06:31) SPEAKER_03: All right, colleagues, that brings us to District 8.
(1:06:35) SPEAKER_03: And I am going to beg your forgiveness.
(1:06:43) SPEAKER_03: Of course, for June, we get very excited about lining up special LGBTQ individuals to get honored at each of our Tuesday board meetings.
(1:06:53) SPEAKER_03: And last week,
(1:06:55) SPEAKER_03: Because of circumstances beyond our control, our honoree was not able to be honored.
(1:06:59) SPEAKER_03: And so I invited her to come back.
(1:07:00) SPEAKER_03: But we also have another great honoree for today.
(1:07:04) SPEAKER_03: So I'm giving myself a presidential privilege to do two in one day.
(1:07:09) SPEAKER_03: And I beg your forgiveness.
(1:07:13) SPEAKER_03: First up, I'm going to ask Ron Gaulman to come up.
(1:07:28) SPEAKER_03: So, Ron is the San Francisco Symphony's longtime director of education and youth orchestra, and he is retiring this month after 42 years of service to the symphony.
(1:07:41) SPEAKER_03: Since joining the symphony staff in 1983, Ron has been a visionary leader whose work has transformed the way orchestras engage with their communities.
(1:07:49) SPEAKER_03: Appointed Director of Education and Youth Orchestra in 1995, Ron has overseen the conceptualization, implementation, and management of the symphonies portfolio of educational programs, initiatives that have become national models under his leadership.
(1:08:04) SPEAKER_03: Described by the Wall Street Journal as the industry standard and hailed by the New York Times as a music education powerhouse, these programs have opened the world of music to countless young people and families.
(1:08:17) SPEAKER_03: Throughout his tenure, Ron has led with heart,
(1:08:19) SPEAKER_03: humility, and the strong conviction that music has the power to inspire and motivate young musicians.
(1:08:27) SPEAKER_03: He launched and continuously grew the Adventures in Music program, which has reached every student in grades one through five in San Francisco's public elementary schools since 1988.
(1:08:36) SPEAKER_03: He's overseen concerts for kids, music for families, Inside Music, and SFSkids.org, the symphonies interactive digital learning platform.
(1:08:46) SPEAKER_03: His commitment to young musicians is perhaps best reflected in his stewardship of the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra, which is flourished under his guidance as one of the finest ensembles of its kind in the world.
(1:08:58) SPEAKER_03: Ronald also championed lifelong learning and community engagement
(1:09:01) SPEAKER_03: through programs like Community of Music Makers, which brought amateur musicians onto the stage at Davies Symphony Hall to make music alongside symphony professionals.
(1:09:11) SPEAKER_03: Across every initiative, Ron has ensured that the symphony's educational offerings reflect the highest standards of excellence, access, and inclusion.
(1:09:20) SPEAKER_03: In addition to his work at the symphony, Ron has been a powerful advocate for arts education at the local, state, and national levels.
(1:09:27) SPEAKER_03: He's represented San Francisco at conferences hosted by the League of American Orchestras, Americans for the Arts, and the Arts Education Partnership, and has served on panels for the National Endowment for the Arts and the California Arts Council.
(1:09:38) SPEAKER_03: He's a longtime member of the San Francisco Community Music Center where he chaired the program committee and served two terms as chair of the National Education Leadership Committee of the League of American Orchestras.
(1:09:49) SPEAKER_03: A proud District 8 resident since 1982, Ron has also contributed as a performing artist, singing for 40 years as a volunteer member of the San Francisco Symphony Chorus.
(1:09:59) SPEAKER_03: His deep love for music, community, and public service has left an enduring legacy in San Francisco and well beyond.
(1:10:05) SPEAKER_03: Thank you, Ron, for the immeasurable impact you've had on the lives of generations of students, families, and musicians, and for your contributions to ensure that San Francisco remains a global leader in arts and culture.
(1:10:16) SPEAKER_03: Congratulations, Ron, and happy retirement.
(1:10:24) SPEAKER_12: Thank you.
(1:10:25) SPEAKER_12: Thank you so much, President Mandelman, and thank you to the Board of Supervisors.
(1:10:30) SPEAKER_12: Of course, as you can imagine, I'm deeply, deeply honored to receive this commendation.
(1:10:35) SPEAKER_12: It's wonderful to be recognized for 42 years of
(1:10:43) SPEAKER_12: really dedication and service to the cause of the arts and arts education in San Francisco.
(1:10:50) SPEAKER_12: My work has been working with the arts, ensuring that everyone has a place in the arts and that the arts can serve everyone in our city.
(1:11:04) SPEAKER_12: and especially San Francisco's public school children, but also reaching every community of San Francisco, our state nationally and beyond, internationally.
(1:11:19) SPEAKER_12: I must thank and give credit to the San Francisco Symphony for its ongoing investment in music education in this city.
(1:11:29) SPEAKER_12: That really has fueled my work over these past four decades being associated with an organization that is so committed
(1:11:40) SPEAKER_12: to ensuring that as a core part of its mission that it serves its community through art and arts education services.
(1:11:51) SPEAKER_12: And of course, I am very, very pleased and very much inspired by the longstanding relationship between the symphony and the San Francisco Unified School District.
(1:12:06) SPEAKER_12: My work with the San Francisco Unified School District is also another one of those aspects that has fueled me working in partnership with the district to ensure that every single child in San Francisco gets a well-rounded and balanced education that includes music and the arts.
(1:12:31) SPEAKER_12: I would say that we all know that support for the arts is critical in keeping San Francisco, this city, vibrant.
(1:12:41) SPEAKER_12: And as I step down from my role as the San Francisco Symphony's Director of Education and Youth Orchestra after 42 years, I very much am looking forward to
(1:12:53) SPEAKER_12: seeing, watching, and doing what I can to help continue to ensure that the arts really remain vibrant, that they grow, and that they thrive, because those can only be good things for us, the city of San Francisco.
(1:13:12) SPEAKER_12: So, thank you very, very much.
(1:13:14) SPEAKER_12: I'm very, very honored.
(1:14:04) SPEAKER_03: All right, one week late.
(1:14:06) SPEAKER_03: Rebecca Roth, come on up.
(1:14:15) SPEAKER_03: Rebecca has spent a lot of time in this chamber over the years.
(1:14:21) SPEAKER_03: In June, it has not always been enjoyable.
(1:14:25) SPEAKER_03: And you've got to sit through two special accommodations.
(1:14:29) SPEAKER_03: So thank you for sticking with it.
(1:14:33) SPEAKER_03: For this final Tuesday of Pride Month, it is my honor to present a special commendation to Rebecca Rolf, who will be retiring later this year from the San Francisco LGBT Center, which she has led so very capably for 17 years.
(1:14:50) SPEAKER_03: She joined the Center staff in 2003 as the Deputy Executive Director, one year after it first opened its doors at 1800 Market Street.
(1:14:59) SPEAKER_03: In that role, she oversaw the organization's budget, staff, and community programs.
(1:15:04) SPEAKER_03: In April of 2007, the board selected her to serve as executive director.
(1:15:09) SPEAKER_03: She would turn out to have been an inspired choice.
(1:15:14) SPEAKER_03: During her nearly two decades leading the center, she has helped to make it one of San Francisco's indispensable queer organizations.
(1:15:21) SPEAKER_03: A community hub that offers housing resources, employment and financial services, arts and culture programming, and support for youth and trans communities.
(1:15:31) SPEAKER_03: The mission of the LGBT Center is to connect our diverse community to opportunities, resources, and each other to achieve our vision of a stronger, healthier, and more equitable world for LGBT people and our allies.
(1:15:45) SPEAKER_03: The mission is an inspiring one, but I do not believe the Center would have survived to fulfill that mission without Rebecca's leadership.
(1:15:53) SPEAKER_03: Indeed, in its early days, burdened by crushing construction debt and finances that, as a consequence, never quite balanced out
(1:16:01) SPEAKER_03: The center's survival was an open question.
(1:16:04) SPEAKER_03: In 2017, Rebecca and her board put that question to rest with a $10.3 million new market tax credit-funded major capital remodel that remade the physical structure to better serve community needs and generate more revenue for the center's ongoing operations.
(1:16:20) SPEAKER_03: Before she joined the center, Rebecca served eight years as the executive director for San Francisco Women Against Rape, managing its budget,
(1:16:26) SPEAKER_03: developing and expanding its programs, and raising grant funds to sustain the community-based rape crisis center.
(1:16:32) SPEAKER_03: And between her executive director roles, Rebecca worked as a policy analyst for our own department on the status of women, her work involved analyzing data related to gender discrimination issues, affecting women, and making recommendations for new policy.
(1:16:45) SPEAKER_03: Rebecca, you have accomplished amazing things in your professional life, and especially at the center of these last 22 years.
(1:16:53) SPEAKER_03: It has been a privilege to be able to work with you to learn from you, to benefit from your counsel.
(1:16:59) SPEAKER_03: Your retirement is very well deserved, but nonetheless bittersweet for me.
(1:17:07) SPEAKER_03: I don't want to say I will miss you because I very much hope and strongly suspect that you will continue to find ways to engage in the fights for justice, and equality, and a more perfect San Francisco.
(1:17:18) SPEAKER_03: For now, I will just say, Rebecca Rolf, we love you very, very much.
(1:17:22) SPEAKER_03: We thank you very, very much.
(1:17:25) SPEAKER_03: And with that, the floor is yours.
(1:17:36) SPEAKER_08: Thank you so much, President Mandelman, and thank you so much to the Board of Supervisors.
(1:17:41) SPEAKER_08: I have spent a lot of time in this chamber, as recently as yesterday, when I had one minute limit, and I was like, I'll be back tomorrow, so now you're hostage.
(1:17:51) SPEAKER_08: But I really want to accept this award on behalf of community, the queer community here in San Francisco, the incredibly, beautifully, broadly diverse community that we are part of and serve.
(1:18:04) SPEAKER_08: I want to thank the people, the center has been a labor of love not just for me but for so many people who have labored so hard to make sure that this is an institution that lasts for our community and that what we offer every single day really speaks to the broad needs of our community.
(1:18:22) SPEAKER_08: and that we continue to be here to meet those needs, to fill in the gaps, to identify what's emerging.
(1:18:29) SPEAKER_08: Because the truth is that across the country our community is under attack and that includes here in San Francisco.
(1:18:35) SPEAKER_08: Especially trans and non-binary individuals, along with immigrants and asylum seekers, black folks, we are all under attack.
(1:18:44) SPEAKER_08: The hatred that we are witnessing is not new, but it is escalating.
(1:18:50) SPEAKER_08: From policies that seek to erase our very existence, to widespread funding cuts, to vital safety net programs, to the targeting of those who dare to speak out against discrimination and rising fascism,
(1:19:03) SPEAKER_08: the threats are imminent.
(1:19:06) SPEAKER_08: Even in San Francisco, we continue to face the impact of homophobia, transphobia, and the impact, the intersections of racism and gender bias in housing, healthcare, employment, and safety.
(1:19:20) SPEAKER_08: At the same time, we're seeing more people arrive seeking sanctuary, resources, and refuge.
(1:19:27) SPEAKER_08: We owe it to each other to be ready to meet that need.
(1:19:30) SPEAKER_08: And all this is happening at a time when we are facing huge budget challenges from the federal government and at a local level.
(1:19:38) SPEAKER_08: These are impacting our programs and services and resulting in reduced services for our community, most tragically for the most vulnerable members of our community.
(1:19:48) SPEAKER_08: Leadership matters.
(1:19:49) SPEAKER_08: I really appreciate you recognizing my leadership, but no one leader can solve what we're up against.
(1:19:54) SPEAKER_08: It is going to take all of us.
(1:19:56) SPEAKER_08: I look forward to continuing to work with partnership and partnership with all of you, with the incredible organizations that make up the fabric of this community and this city, with the many citizens, the queer community, all of our allied communities.
(1:20:09) SPEAKER_08: Because to find a solution, we need each other.
(1:20:13) SPEAKER_08: We need to protect each other.
(1:20:14) SPEAKER_08: We need to show up for a community.
(1:20:16) SPEAKER_08: We need to show up for each other.
(1:20:17) SPEAKER_08: And we need to invest in the organizations that we want to see and do this moment.
(1:20:22) SPEAKER_08: So thank you so much for this on behalf of the community.
(1:20:25) SPEAKER_08: It is my pleasure and my honor to serve such an incredible community and to stand with so many amazing leaders who are honored here today.
(1:20:31) SPEAKER_08: I'm a little intimidated.
(1:20:33) SPEAKER_08: But it's just a pleasure and an honor.
(1:20:36) SPEAKER_08: So thank you so much.
(1:21:25) SPEAKER_09: I think madam clerk that takes us to public comment Thank You mr. President at this time the board welcomes your general public comment if you'll line up on the right hand side of the chamber","During this Pride Month meeting, several San Francisco community leaders were honored for their contributions to LGBTQ+ advocacy and city life. Supervisor Matt Haney recognized Harry Bro for his decades of service supporting people with HIV/AIDS and his work on the Department of Disability and Aging Services Advisory Council, including creating the Pride Flag mural at Jane Warner Plaza in the Castro. Minister Marvin K. White was celebrated by Supervisor Safai for his spiritual leadership at Glide Memorial Church and his poetry work that centers queer and BIPOC narratives. Supervisor Dorsey honored James ""Jim"" Haas, a longtime District 6 resident and urbanist whose legal career and LGBTQ+ activism helped shape San Francisco's transportation policies and Civic Center improvements. Supervisor Faider recognized Malia Español and Mother Bar, a lesbian and queer bar in the Mission District that serves as a sanctuary for queer women and femmes. Supervisor Chan honored Madeleine Lim, a queer immigrant filmmaker who runs QuackMap and its annual Queer Women of Color Film Festival, though funding challenges threaten the organization's future. President Mandelman acknowledged Ronald Gaulman for his 42-year career with the San Francisco Symphony, where he led education programs reaching public school students, and Rebecca Rolf, who is retiring after 17 years leading the San Francisco LGBT Center, helping it become a vital community hub offering housing, employment, and cultural services. Each honoree spoke briefly about their work and the importance of continuing support for LGBTQ+ spaces and initiatives during challenging political times.

(1:22:04) SPEAKER_04: You put it better than a divine sentence is in the lips of the king.
(1:22:09) SPEAKER_04: His mouth transgresseth not in judgment.
(1:22:13) SPEAKER_04: A just weight and balance are the lords.
(1:22:17) SPEAKER_04: All the weights of the bag are his work.
(1:22:21) SPEAKER_04: It is an abomination to kings.
(1:22:24) SPEAKER_04: And you're all like little kings, right?
(1:22:26) SPEAKER_04: But it says here, it's an abomination to kings to commit wickedness.
(1:22:32) SPEAKER_04: because the throne is established by righteousness.
(1:22:35) SPEAKER_04: Righteous lips are the delight of kings, and they love him that speaketh right.
(1:22:44) SPEAKER_04: The wrath of a king is as a messenger's of death, but a wise man will pacify it.
(1:22:50) SPEAKER_04: Pride goeth before destruction and in haughty spirit before a fall.
(1:22:55) SPEAKER_04: Better it is to be of a humble spirit with a lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud.
(1:23:02) SPEAKER_04: Pride is always spoken of in a negative manner in the Word of God.
(1:23:07) SPEAKER_04: It's always spoken of.
(1:23:09) SPEAKER_04: But if you're proud about sin, if I'm proud about being a lady's man, you know,
(1:23:15) SPEAKER_04: I should be ashamed of being a lady's man if I was a lady's man.
(1:23:19) SPEAKER_04: And you should be ashamed if you're a homosexual.
(1:23:22) SPEAKER_04: God condemns it.
(1:23:23) SPEAKER_04: It doesn't mean you cannot be forgiven.
(1:23:26) SPEAKER_04: But it does mean that God condemns it.
(1:23:28) SPEAKER_04: There have been people that used to be homosexuals and then they got saved.
(1:23:33) SPEAKER_04: I used to preach with a guy at UC Berkeley.
(1:23:36) SPEAKER_04: What's his name?
(1:23:38) SPEAKER_04: He was a manager of a gay bar, and he became a Christian.
(1:23:42) SPEAKER_04: I forgot the guy's name, but Jesus is coming soon.
(1:23:45) SPEAKER_04: He really is.
(1:23:46) SPEAKER_04: When Trump made his Easter profession, that was after 360 sabbatical cycles and 360 months from the start of the times of the Gentiles, that Jesus' death and resurrection was the greatest event in history, and it was.
(1:24:01) SPEAKER_04: He's coming soon.
(1:24:02) SPEAKER_04: Call out to him today.
(1:24:04) SPEAKER_17: Thank you, Mark.
(1:24:06) SPEAKER_17: Let's hear from our next speaker.
(1:24:08) SPEAKER_17: We'll come and collect that from you.
(1:24:23) SPEAKER_07: Good afternoon, Board of Supervisors.
(1:24:24) SPEAKER_07: For the record, my name is Chris Fort Klein.
(1:24:26) SPEAKER_07: I also go by Sergeant Klein of the United States Marine Corps.
(1:24:29) SPEAKER_07: I just passed out a portion of a document that was submitted to federal court, and I have until July 14th, 2025, to file an amended claim with specific incidents for each one of the four questions.
(1:24:39) SPEAKER_07: Pay particular attention to questions two and three when violations of FISA guidelines.
(1:24:45) SPEAKER_07: However, today I'm asking the city and county of San Francisco to join forces with me in a class action lawsuit against state sponsored terrorism so that the victims in San Francisco can receive funds from the Congress enacted by statute fund set up for US victims of state sponsored terrorism.
(1:25:03) SPEAKER_07: San Francisco was victimized for a variety of reasons, such as politicians that represent San Francisco, be it at the local, state, and federal level.
(1:25:12) SPEAKER_07: You host fleet week every year, there's a large veteran population, and there are still military presence in or around San Francisco to include the 23rd Marines, Travis Air Force Base, Pilar Point Air Force Base, that is currently being used for US space force and several other units.
(1:25:30) SPEAKER_07: Unfortunately, the deadline for the sixth installment has passed.
(1:25:34) SPEAKER_07: I urge each of you in this room to partner and join forces so that the victims can be compensated and San Francisco can get its fair share of the fund.
(1:25:41) SPEAKER_07: The deadline just passed was on June 2nd, 2025, and I previously presented prior to that date.
(1:25:48) SPEAKER_07: I'm confused and dismayed by several who have refused to move on this at a much quicker pace.
(1:25:54) SPEAKER_07: As San Francisco suffers, perhaps one of its most financial downfalls in history.
(1:25:59) SPEAKER_07: Let's work together, San Francisco, not against each other.
(1:26:01) SPEAKER_07: Again, there's going to be another date, but that doesn't fix your budget for this year and next year.
(1:26:07) SPEAKER_07: If it would have been submitted on time, there wouldn't have been a budget issue this year.
(1:26:12) SPEAKER_07: Thank you.
(1:26:13) SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your comments.
(1:26:14) SPEAKER_02: Next speaker.
(1:26:19) SPEAKER_09: I have a handout for each one of your board supervisors.
(1:26:33) SPEAKER_09: I'm asking for the police department to have facial recognition and the police department.
(1:26:42) SPEAKER_09: That's what the letters regarding.
(1:26:44) SPEAKER_09: It's for every one of them.
(1:26:57) SPEAKER_15: Please continue.
(1:26:59) SPEAKER_17: You have a minute and 35 seconds left.
(1:27:00) SPEAKER_09: That's all.
(1:27:01) SPEAKER_09: That's all I have to say.
(1:27:03) SPEAKER_09: I just want to present the letter to them and for y'all to read it and not just look at it, take it real serious.
(1:27:09) SPEAKER_09: Thank you.
(1:27:13) SPEAKER_17: Thank you.
(1:27:14) SPEAKER_17: Let's hear from our next speaker.
(1:27:15) SPEAKER_17: Welcome.
(1:27:16) SPEAKER_08: Good afternoon, city supervisors and fellow esteemed neuroscientists.
(1:27:23) SPEAKER_08: It's Pride Week as we're all aware.
(1:27:25) SPEAKER_08: And for me and my family and for much of San Francisco, this is as close to a holy holiday as we're possibly going to get.
(1:27:32) SPEAKER_08: But it's dire times.
(1:27:34) SPEAKER_08: And recently, the FBI has set up a hotline for anyone to call in to report health clinics that might be harming children by, quote, performing general mutilations.
(1:27:45) SPEAKER_08: Now, this is a thinly veiled attempt at
(1:27:49) SPEAKER_08: anti-trans propaganda, and specifically anti-gender affirming care propaganda.
(1:27:54) SPEAKER_08: It's a vile act.
(1:27:56) SPEAKER_08: Now, reading the writing on the wall, UCSF, Stanford, and the Gender Confirming Center here, right here, have all ceased providing gender affirming care for anyone under 19.
(1:28:08) SPEAKER_08: That happened this week.
(1:28:12) SPEAKER_08: Not to be undone in acts of abject cowardice, our mayor somehow, either accidentally, but very likely purposefully,
(1:28:19) SPEAKER_08: did not include the trans flag in the Pride flag raising ceremony at City Hall.
(1:28:27) SPEAKER_08: Now, this is the first time that this has happened since I can remember.
(1:28:30) SPEAKER_08: We have lots of photographic evidence showing the trans flag right there behind every mayor's speech for as long as I can remember.
(1:28:37) SPEAKER_08: That did not happen this year.
(1:28:39) SPEAKER_08: Okay, it's not surprising for a conservative mayor who is cooperating with ICE, but it is quite frankly a surprise for this city.
(1:28:48) SPEAKER_08: Now, your job as legislatures, as a legislative branch of this government, and I can't believe I have to tell you this, but I do, your job is to check the mayor's executive power.
(1:28:57) SPEAKER_08: It is not to stand behind him in social media posts smiling like you're his personal assistant ready to do his bidding.
(1:29:06) SPEAKER_08: Okay?
(1:29:07) SPEAKER_08: He is not your constituency.
(1:29:09) SPEAKER_08: We are.
(1:29:09) SPEAKER_08: The people of San Francisco are.
(1:29:12) SPEAKER_08: It's Tuesday.
(1:29:13) SPEAKER_08: Pride March
(1:29:15) SPEAKER_08: is Sunday, the trans march is Friday.
(1:29:17) SPEAKER_08: I expect, and I hope that somewhere in or outside of city hall the pride flag and the trans Thank you for your comments.
(1:29:28) SPEAKER_17: Welcome to the next speaker.
(1:29:31) SPEAKER_10: Good afternoon, supervisors.
(1:29:32) SPEAKER_10: My name is Zachary Freel.
(1:29:33) SPEAKER_10: I'm with SOMCAN and I'm a D5 resident.
(1:29:37) SPEAKER_10: Yesterday, the Budget and Appropriations Committee heard from hundreds of San Franciscans opposing the devastating cuts to our city's social safety net.
(1:29:44) SPEAKER_10: The mayor has chosen to balance the budget by slashing essential services like legal aid, workforce development, food banks, and homelessness services for families and transitional aged youth.
(1:29:54) SPEAKER_10: At the same time, some of the richest corporations in the city, namely Airbnb, Uber and Lyft, have sued the city for over $400 million, prompting the city controller to put hundreds of millions of dollars into a litigation reserve.
(1:30:06) SPEAKER_10: That money could be covering all of the layoffs and all of the cuts to our services in this budget several times over.
(1:30:13) SPEAKER_10: Why should our communities have to suffer because of their greed?
(1:30:16) SPEAKER_10: Billionaires and corporations need to pay their fair share.
(1:30:19) SPEAKER_10: They got rich on our backs.
(1:30:21) SPEAKER_10: They should not be able to hold our tax dollars hostage.
(1:30:24) SPEAKER_10: However, our city is prevented from passing a wealth tax on those who have exploited our labor, flipped our homes, and displaced our community members to get rich.
(1:30:33) SPEAKER_10: We support Supervisors Chen, Chan, Walton, and Fielders resolution and call upon our representatives in Sacramento, Assemblymember Matt Haney, Assemblymember Catherine Stephanie, and Senator Scott Wiener to pass legislation that will allow local jurisdictions like ours to pass a wealth tax.
(1:30:50) SPEAKER_10: Billionaires and corporations need to pay their fair share and we need to redistribute the wealth to our communities.
(1:30:56) SPEAKER_10: Thank you.
(1:30:57) SPEAKER_17: Thank you for your comments.
(1:30:58) SPEAKER_17: Let's hear from our next speaker.
(1:31:08) SPEAKER_01: Good afternoon.
(1:31:10) SPEAKER_01: My name is Mary Trammell.
(1:31:12) SPEAKER_01: And I was here in early May to discuss why I haven't gotten my settlement from the city.
(1:31:23) SPEAKER_01: I used to work for the Human Rights Commission.
(1:31:27) SPEAKER_01: Hi, Mr. Walton.
(1:31:28) SPEAKER_01: I know you represent my district.
(1:31:30) SPEAKER_17: Ma'am, please address your comments to the board as a whole.
(1:31:33) SPEAKER_01: I just spoke to him.
(1:31:34) SPEAKER_01: That's all.
(1:31:35) SPEAKER_01: I know he's a part of the board as you are.
(1:31:38) SPEAKER_01: And I have not been paid.
(1:31:40) SPEAKER_01: It was settled in December of last year.
(1:31:46) SPEAKER_01: The last time my attorney would speak to me was in early March.
(1:31:52) SPEAKER_01: And he told me that before I would get settled that the board of supervisors and the mayor, your case has to go before them.
(1:32:02) SPEAKER_01: Now, there's three other co-workers of mine that was fired from the Human Rights Commission.
(1:32:08) SPEAKER_01: And they didn't wait no seven months.
(1:32:13) SPEAKER_01: And I'm here to say that I had a good experience working for the city.
(1:32:18) SPEAKER_01: But you need to take a close look at who you hire for directors and managers, because those people are not on the same wavelength as you.
(1:32:28) SPEAKER_01: They want you to do what they want you to do.
(1:32:30) SPEAKER_01: They don't want you to obey the rules and regulations.
(1:32:33) SPEAKER_01: And I'm an old farm girl.
(1:32:35) SPEAKER_01: We crop tobacco.
(1:32:36) SPEAKER_01: You had one way to do it, and that was right.
(1:32:39) SPEAKER_01: Well, these city managers and directors, they are lascivious and sneaky.
(1:32:45) SPEAKER_01: And I was here a month ago.
(1:32:48) SPEAKER_01: The lady in the pink over there is the one that had someone to get my phone number and personal information e-mail and so forth.
(1:32:55) SPEAKER_01: I haven't heard from nobody.
(1:32:57) SPEAKER_01: I went down to my lawyer's office in Redwood City.
(1:33:00) SPEAKER_01: He, I don't know if he was in there or not.
(1:33:03) SPEAKER_01: Knocked on his door.
(1:33:04) SPEAKER_01: He didn't ask, twisted the door knob.
(1:33:06) SPEAKER_01: It was locked.
(1:33:07) SPEAKER_01: Now, who do I need to talk to?
(1:33:10) SPEAKER_01: Who can I talk to?
(1:33:11) SPEAKER_01: Will somebody tell me what the hell is going on?
(1:33:14) SPEAKER_01: I don't want to have to go to channel seven.
(1:33:16) SPEAKER_17: I have some information for you.
(1:33:17) SPEAKER_01: If you'll just step over to the... The lady in the pink did that in early May, and I hope you can get back to me.
(1:33:25) SPEAKER_17: I have information for you.
(1:33:26) SPEAKER_17: Please step over.
(1:33:26) SPEAKER_17: Thank you.
(1:33:28) SPEAKER_17: Let's hear from our next speaker, please.
(1:33:47) SPEAKER_06: You're not American, you're white.
(1:34:01) SPEAKER_06: This is the warm welcome you'll receive from Diana Del...
(1:34:05) SPEAKER_06: Delgado and fellow employees of Simcoe restaurants at Pier 39, if you're not privy to being a foreign national fucking off our own, our own being citizens.
(1:34:15) SPEAKER_06: Let me ask, could I make such a statement without being charged with a hate crime?
(1:34:20) SPEAKER_06: Could I make such a statement and retain my employment?
(1:34:23) SPEAKER_06: Could I make such a statement and not be defined a fascist?
(1:34:27) SPEAKER_06: To be clear, I am for immigration, but what I'm not for is for foreign citizens fucking off our own, whether that be by denial of wages, stealing our jobs, or murdering us with drugs, while holding us to standards they do not follow themselves.
(1:34:42) SPEAKER_06: To anyone bitching for reparations for dead ancestors they never knew, don't forget mine for being strangled for 35 minutes.
(1:34:50) SPEAKER_06: To then be charged with criminal damage to property and spend four months in custody for taking down a curtain with shit on it.
(1:34:57) SPEAKER_06: Among the other countless crimes committed by the shit of every race that makes everything a race issue instead of a mutual respect issue.
(1:35:05) SPEAKER_06: Ms.
(1:35:05) SPEAKER_06: Chen, you bitch today about our rights being taken away by the federal government.
(1:35:09) SPEAKER_06: What about the city government?
(1:35:11) SPEAKER_06: Are you living with shit stapled to your wall, miss Chen?
(1:35:15) SPEAKER_06: While my Asian landlord defines me as a freeloading drug addict, as I'm denied due wages, sexually assaulted at work, and laughed at, as I'm asked if I want to go back to jail?
(1:35:26) SPEAKER_06: Are you all living with shit stapled to your walls?
(1:35:30) SPEAKER_06: We've got an $840 million police budget with more than three quarters of those officers not being residents of San Francisco.
(1:35:37) SPEAKER_06: Here's all of our money.
(1:35:39) SPEAKER_06: Please don't fuck us off.
(1:35:41) SPEAKER_06: I think we've seen how great that ideology has worked out.
(1:35:45) SPEAKER_06: Despite the public health department having a $3.2 billion budget, during my most recent incarceration, I witnessed multiple individuals remaining with shit in their pants for a week at
(1:35:56) SPEAKER_02: Speaker's time has expired.
(1:36:02) SPEAKER_02: Next speaker please.
(1:36:11) SPEAKER_15: Next speaker.
(1:36:22) SPEAKER_05: Greetings and salutations San Francisco.
(1:36:25) SPEAKER_05: My name is Sean Sunshine Strickland, the Stricklator, sometimes known as the Supergirl of San Francisco.
(1:36:31) SPEAKER_05: And I just want to take a moment of time for us to reflect and pray for the good people here in the city, all of you.
(1:36:38) SPEAKER_05: And please join me for about 10 seconds of silence.
(1:36:57) SPEAKER_05: My message is to Donald Trump, the President of the United States of America.
(1:37:05) SPEAKER_05: You claim to be a person who believes in unity and peace.
(1:37:11) SPEAKER_05: And yet your actions and your words reflect otherwise.
(1:37:15) SPEAKER_05: If you were truly a person of peace who had agape love, great spirit love inside of your heart and soul, then you would be doing things and saying things to bring people together.
(1:37:32) SPEAKER_05: Not just a United States of America, but also helping to pave the path forward to a United Earth.
(1:37:42) SPEAKER_05: That's what I believe in.
(1:37:43) SPEAKER_05: I'm not sure what you believe in.
(1:37:46) SPEAKER_05: You've been giving nothing but pain and suffering to the people when you should be giving love.
(1:37:53) SPEAKER_05: Love is the first thing that should come out of your mouth.
(1:37:57) SPEAKER_05: I believe in infinite diversity and infinite combinations.
(1:38:02) SPEAKER_05: I believe in love, respect, and understanding to all human beings.
(1:38:07) SPEAKER_05: And I believe that everyone is created equal.
(1:38:10) SPEAKER_05: and that every life, all LGBT, QIA life, all people of the rainbow should be treated with love, respect, and understanding on the planet Earth.
(1:38:23) SPEAKER_05: Thank you.
(1:38:25) SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your comments.
(1:38:27) SPEAKER_02: Next speaker.
(1:38:32) SPEAKER_17: Hi.
(1:38:34) SPEAKER_11: My name is Chanel, ENDC, board member, director of higher education.
(1:38:40) SPEAKER_11: I just want to speak to the supervisors who are involved with the budget committee, you know who you are.
(1:38:49) SPEAKER_11: And mentioned it about in 2000, well, actually 2016, voters voted for a free city college.
(1:38:59) SPEAKER_11: And it did so well like two years later, 2019.
(1:39:02) SPEAKER_11: A budget was re-voted to have 10 years of city college free.
(1:39:14) SPEAKER_11: So, as promised, we supposed to have City College supposed to be free, and that we supposed to have that $14 million, I believe, in 2024, 25, but we only got half of that, and that is promised that we'll get like 7.2, but it got up to, I believe,
(1:39:35) SPEAKER_11: 9.3 but that that is not enough it's like we fell short so I just urge you that you put more money into the play for like 17 or 18 mil because it was his promise for us to have 10 years of free you know city college and on a personal note I just want to know I just want to say that um
(1:39:55) SPEAKER_11: I live in New Jersey.
(1:39:56) SPEAKER_11: I'm from South Jersey, and I did go to a community college, and it really saved me, and I had no idea that I had a learned disability.
(1:40:02) SPEAKER_11: So that college helped me gain me confidence to the point that I was able to transfer to another college, which is Rutgers University.
(1:40:11) SPEAKER_11: And I just wanted to say that I wish I'd be able to pay free at my time, and I'm not going to mention my age, but back in the day.
(1:40:20) SPEAKER_11: And I just hope that this is an opportunity for anyone who wants the education because, you know, mine is a terrible thing in ways.
(1:40:30) SPEAKER_11: We had this opportunity.
(1:40:31) SPEAKER_11: We voted for it.
(1:40:32) SPEAKER_11: Our taxpayer money voted for this.
(1:40:35) SPEAKER_11: And I hope, I hope.
(1:40:38) SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your comments.
(1:40:43) SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your comments.
(1:40:47) SPEAKER_02: Next speaker, please.
(1:40:53) SPEAKER_12: We was here to speak on behalf of our mother.
(1:40:58) SPEAKER_12: She just came up to you guys and handed out a letter.
(1:41:01) SPEAKER_12: We just wanted to read part of the letter, basically regarding injustice with our brother who got killed last year.
(1:41:10) SPEAKER_12: We just wanted to see if it's possible to pass the law for facial recognition, but we'll read you part of the letter.
(1:41:18) SPEAKER_12: I am writing to respectfully urge the board to revisit and reconsider the current policy prohibiting the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement in San Francisco.
(1:41:32) SPEAKER_12: As a concerned resident and advocate for public safety, I believe that with appropriate safeguards, this technology can be a powerful tool to enhance public safety, assist investigations, and improve the overall effectiveness of police work.
(1:41:47) SPEAKER_12: When used responsibly and transparently, facial recognition can help identify suspects in serious crimes, locate missing people, and prevent real-time threats.
(1:42:02) SPEAKER_12: Many major cities around the world are successfully incorporating this technology into their public safety strategies.
(1:42:09) SPEAKER_12: San Francisco as a public leader in both tech innovations and civil rights is uniquely positioned to set the standard for ethical and regulated use.
(1:42:19) SPEAKER_12: So we just wanted to bring that up to your knowledge just because San Francisco does not have a facial recognition thing for SFPD and we were just wondering if it can get waived.
(1:42:34) SPEAKER_12: And yeah, that's all we wanted to say further.
(1:42:37) SPEAKER_12: Thank you.
(1:42:38) SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your comments.
(1:42:39) SPEAKER_13: Next speaker.
(1:42:56) SPEAKER_13: Yesterday I was they had this brown if you could speak into the light yesterday they had they had the Juneteenth and I was marching with the mayor and I marched with this picture as I bring my pictures here all the time and the SFPD the the fire department and all of them we were all marching so it was hard for me to walk with this picture
(1:43:22) SPEAKER_13: We said Juneteenth was the day that freedom, but our children aren't free.
(1:43:28) SPEAKER_13: Our children that are being murdered on the street aren't free.
(1:43:32) SPEAKER_13: I bring this picture of my son all the time saying he's one of those children.
(1:43:40) SPEAKER_13: My son was shot with a semi-automatic gun, 30 rounds of bullets, left that gun to my son, saving someone else's life.
(1:43:50) SPEAKER_13: I come here and I say, I don't just fight for my child, but I think about all other mothers and fathers that are out there suffering.
(1:43:57) SPEAKER_13: Look at all these unsolved homicides and murders that are not solved.
(1:44:03) SPEAKER_13: And mothers like myself and other mothers are still suffering in silence.
(1:44:07) SPEAKER_13: This is the picture I walked with the mayor and asked him, you know, I believe that he understands what's going on with those mothers.
(1:44:19) SPEAKER_13: You know when you get in, you said accountability, service, and justice.
(1:44:24) SPEAKER_13: That's what we need.
(1:44:25) SPEAKER_13: Next month will be, here's another unsolved homicide.
(1:44:32) SPEAKER_13: Maddie Scott's child is over here.
(1:44:36) SPEAKER_13: This is what the perpetrators left me, a lifeless body.
(1:44:41) SPEAKER_13: This is what they left me, my son laying on a gurney lifeless.
(1:44:45) SPEAKER_13: Who wants to see that?
(1:44:46) SPEAKER_13: This is what I have to remember for the rest of my life.
(1:44:49) SPEAKER_13: He was my only son.
(1:44:51) SPEAKER_13: We said hate crimes.
(1:44:53) SPEAKER_13: This was a hate crime.
(1:44:55) SPEAKER_13: I don't care about black on black crime.
(1:44:58) SPEAKER_13: This was a hate crime.
(1:45:00) SPEAKER_13: And mothers like myself are still suffering.
(1:45:02) SPEAKER_13: Something needs to be done.
(1:45:04) SPEAKER_13: I am tired.
(1:45:06) SPEAKER_02: Thank you, Ms.
(1:45:06) SPEAKER_02: Brown.
(1:45:10) SPEAKER_02: Next speaker, please.
(1:45:22) SPEAKER_16: Good afternoon.
(1:45:24) SPEAKER_16: My name is Richard S.D.
(1:45:26) SPEAKER_16: Peterson to the board and to the supervisor at large.
(1:45:32) SPEAKER_16: You know, I want to apologize that I used to be a fairly decent extemporaneous speaker when I was a trial attorney.
(1:45:42) SPEAKER_16: Since long COVID and a couple of strokes, I've been
(1:45:48) SPEAKER_16: My mind has been a little waddled and that's why I've got out of intellectual property law and now into fortune telling because fortune telling is far more easy and predictive and if you've seen the ads on TV for lawyers apparently you can say pretty much what you want.
(1:46:10) SPEAKER_16: As a fortune teller there are an innumerable number of restrictions including advertising and
(1:46:18) SPEAKER_16: And I don't know how I'm supposed to contact clients.
(1:46:20) SPEAKER_16: I mean, psychically, is that the way?
(1:46:24) SPEAKER_16: But the topic I really want to talk about is productive protest.
(1:46:30) SPEAKER_16: As you know, last week, this meeting was disrupted for about four hours by a so-called city service union serving the public.
(1:46:42) SPEAKER_16: And as a public member,
(1:46:44) SPEAKER_16: I only can stand and I only can stay so long before all of a sudden I'm gonna either fall down.
(1:46:53) SPEAKER_16: That's why I wear a
(1:46:54) SPEAKER_16: protective motorcycle jacket or not.
(1:46:59) SPEAKER_16: So productive, that's not an example of the disruptive nature of that protest was not productive.
(1:47:09) SPEAKER_16: And there are other ways of productive protests.
(1:47:14) SPEAKER_16: If you see in the streets,
(1:47:16) SPEAKER_16: Certainly the no kings thing.
(1:47:19) SPEAKER_16: Why are we waving Mexican flags?
(1:47:23) SPEAKER_16: I just don't know.
(1:47:24) SPEAKER_16: Things are so topsy turvy.
(1:47:26) SPEAKER_16: Thank you.
(1:47:27) SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your comments.
(1:47:35) SPEAKER_03: Good afternoon, supervisors.
(1:47:37) SPEAKER_03: Thank you for letting me speak today.
(1:47:40) SPEAKER_03: My name's Curtis Bradford and I'm just a Tindalline resident and I do community organizing in the neighborhood and in the city.
(1:47:48) SPEAKER_03: But I really wasn't even here today to say anything.
(1:47:51) SPEAKER_03: I came for an event earlier, but after hearing a couple of the comments today, I just felt like I wanted to get up and say something to the folks who are watching.
(1:47:58) SPEAKER_03: which is most of the folks here in San Francisco are good-hearted folks, and we care about each other, we love each other, and we support each other.
(1:48:07) SPEAKER_03: The Tenderloin, for example, is probably the most diverse 49 square blocks in America.
(1:48:12) SPEAKER_03: We have every creed, every race, every religion, every language.
(1:48:18) SPEAKER_03: every sexuality, every orientation, and every gender identity.
(1:48:22) SPEAKER_03: It is an amazing community, and we demonstrate regularly how we can all live together, enjoy and in peace, and support each other.
(1:48:29) SPEAKER_03: And I just want folks listening who might have heard some contradictory messages today that, you know, you're welcome here.
(1:48:38) SPEAKER_03: We love you here.
(1:48:39) SPEAKER_03: The majority of us here love you.
(1:48:41) SPEAKER_03: You're a beautiful person.
(1:48:44) SPEAKER_03: I see you, you're beautiful, God sees you, you're beautiful, and I just want you to know you're loved.
(1:48:51) SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
(1:48:52) SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your comments.
(1:48:54) SPEAKER_02: Next speaker.
(1:48:57) SPEAKER_14: What happened to Angela?
(1:48:59) SPEAKER_14: She just flew away.
(1:49:00) SPEAKER_14: Okay, what's not fake for sure is that intelligence knows that pride is enemy.
(1:49:11) SPEAKER_14: Right?
(1:49:12) SPEAKER_14: Yes.
(1:49:12) SPEAKER_14: OK, such as after that, the stigmatization of colors.
(1:49:16) SPEAKER_14: It's kind of almost surprising that you haven't tried yet a black rainbow.
(1:49:22) SPEAKER_14: Never mind.
(1:49:23) SPEAKER_14: I've got more important to say.
(1:49:25) SPEAKER_14: about these 5G towers, yes, connected to the fact that no matter what, you cannot justify their presence, which is nefarious, by saying that it is for high-speed internet, because I said several times before that speed is danger.
(1:49:44) SPEAKER_14: So high-speed internet means no matter what, high-danger internet, clear enough.
(1:49:50) SPEAKER_14: Solve, yes.
(1:49:54) SPEAKER_14: Now, what's the next stage?
(1:49:58) SPEAKER_14: Because you have now one week to start removing most of these 5G or even 6, I don't know, who knows, things that you didn't ask the people to put on.
(1:50:15) SPEAKER_14: I explained that to you last week when, okay, now never mind, hurry up.
(1:50:20) SPEAKER_14: Don't forget your breakfast with your orange signalization for the fake road work story that you put all over the countryside to peace again.
(1:50:29) SPEAKER_14: Sorry, everybody off.
(1:50:31) SPEAKER_14: This includes your yellow fluorescent yellow globalist signs pretending to care about pedestrians or anybody else whereas it's exactly the opposite.
(1:50:46) SPEAKER_14: Your unintelligence is neutralizing itself, as I said.
(1:50:50) SPEAKER_14: And you make your conspiracy absolutely obvious for everyone.
(1:50:54) SPEAKER_14: Congratulations.
(1:50:55) SPEAKER_14: That's all we need.
(1:50:57) SPEAKER_14: Have a good day.
(1:50:58) SPEAKER_14: See you next week, yes, July 1.
(1:51:01) SPEAKER_17: Thank you for your comments.
(1:51:03) SPEAKER_17: Are there any other members of the public who would like to address the board during general public comment?
(1:51:08) SPEAKER_17: Please step up.
(1:51:09) SPEAKER_17: All right.
(1:51:10) SPEAKER_17: Mr. President.
(1:51:11) SPEAKER_15: Public comment is now closed.
(1:51:13) SPEAKER_15: Madam Clerk, I think we want to reopen roll call.
(1:51:17) SPEAKER_17: Yes, Supervisor Walton asked to reopen roll call.
(1:51:21) SPEAKER_00: Thank you so much, President Mandelman, and thank you, Madam Clerk.
(1:51:25) SPEAKER_00: Colleagues, I do have an end memoriam for this meeting.
(1:51:29) SPEAKER_00: It is with deep sorrow and heartfelt respect that we honor the life and legacy of Queen Aisha, affectionately known as Auntie John, Ina, a true light and leader in the Samoan and Pacific Islander community.
(1:51:46) SPEAKER_00: Queen Aisha Ina was a bright,
(1:51:49) SPEAKER_00: Shining Star.
(1:51:50) SPEAKER_00: Born in South San Francisco, she attended Parkway Middle School and graduated from South San Francisco High School.
(1:51:58) SPEAKER_00: She held close to her heart, her family, her faith, and her second home, the Samoan Community Development Center.
(1:52:06) SPEAKER_00: For 23 years, Queen Aisha devoted herself to SCDC and to the Visitation Valley and Sunnydale neighborhoods.
(1:52:15) SPEAKER_00: Her passion for uplifting the next generation was unmatched, and she worked tirelessly to ensure our youth were embraced with love, guided by culture, and inspired by her unforgettable joy.
(1:52:30) SPEAKER_00: Queen Aisha embodied her culture in every way, through song, through dance, and through her unwavering commitment to preserving and celebrating Pacific Islander traditions.
(1:52:43) SPEAKER_00: Anyone who walked the halls of SCDC knew when the Queen was present.
(1:52:48) SPEAKER_00: You could hear her singing church hymns with power and grace, filling the space with spirit and song.
(1:52:56) SPEAKER_00: At every community event, Queen Aisha brought her full authentic self.
(1:53:01) SPEAKER_00: With pride and confidence, she declared, the Queen is here.
(1:53:06) SPEAKER_00: And the entire room would light up in response.
(1:53:10) SPEAKER_00: She was a force of love, warmth, and hope.
(1:53:13) SPEAKER_00: She created space for our youth to feel seen, supported, and valued.
(1:53:19) SPEAKER_00: Her passing is a tremendous loss, but her legacy is forever.
(1:53:24) SPEAKER_00: It lives on in the heart of SCDC and every young person she mentored and in the strength of a community made better because she was part of it.
(1:53:35) SPEAKER_00: Phi Phi Phi, Tela Lava, Queen.
(1:53:39) SPEAKER_00: Thank you for your service, your spirit, and your unshakable love.
(1:53:44) SPEAKER_00: Long live the Queen.
(1:53:46) SPEAKER_00: The rest I submit.
(1:53:47) SPEAKER_17: Thank you so much, Supervisor Walton.
(1:53:50) SPEAKER_17: Thank you, Mr. President.
(1:53:52) SPEAKER_15: Thank you, Supervisor Walton.
(1:53:53) SPEAKER_15: Thank you, Madam Clerk.
(1:53:54) SPEAKER_15: Let's go to our forward option of that committee reference agenda, items 27 through 31.
(1:54:00) SPEAKER_17: Items 27 through 31.","During the public comment period, several speakers addressed the Board of Supervisors on various issues. Mark spoke about biblical principles regarding pride and righteousness, referencing politicians and making religious commentary. Chris Fort Klein, identifying as a Marine Sergeant, urged the city to join him in a class action lawsuit against state-sponsored terrorism to access federal compensation funds, criticizing the slow response from supervisors. A speaker advocated for the San Francisco Police Department to implement facial recognition technology, distributing letters to supervisors about this request. During Pride Week, another speaker criticized the FBI's hotline targeting gender-affirming healthcare providers and condemned the mayor for not including the trans flag in the Pride ceremony, calling for legislative oversight of executive power. Zachary Freel spoke against budget cuts affecting social services and criticized the mayor for prioritizing litigation reserves over community needs, urging support for a wealth tax resolution. Mary Trammell, a former Human Rights Commission employee, complained about delays in receiving her settlement and criticized city management practices. A speaker addressed immigration issues, claiming foreign nationals were exploiting American workers and calling for accountability from city government. Sean Sunshine Strickland called for unity and peace, addressing the President and advocating for love and respect for all people. Chanel emphasized the importance of free community college education and urged supervisors to fulfill promises made to voters. Two speakers, including a mother named Brown, advocated for facial recognition technology to help solve crimes, particularly referencing unsolved murders of family members. Richard Peterson discussed productive protest methods, criticizing recent disruptive protests while acknowledging his own limitations due to health issues. Curtis Bradford spoke about the diversity and unity of the Tenderloin neighborhood, offering supportive messages to community members. Another speaker criticized 5G towers and fluorescent signage, claiming they were harmful and unjustified. Supervisor Walton presented a memorial honoring Queen Aisha (Auntie John Ina), a community leader in the Samoan and Pacific Islander community who worked extensively with youth at the Samoan Community Development Center. The meeting then proceeded to agenda items 27 through 31 regarding budget matters.",{}

One member, Supervisor Cheryl, requests that item 29 be pulled from the agenda. The clerk is then asked to call the roll for voting on the remaining items (27, 28, 30, and 31), with Supervisor Cheryl and Supervisor Walton both voting ""aye"" in favor of the resolution.

(1:55:20) SPEAKER_01: And to reaffirm its commitment to an open, inclusive, and safe city that actively opposes all forms of hate, including those based on religion, ethnicity, race, sex, national origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression and disability.
(1:55:39) SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Madam Clerk.
(1:55:40) SPEAKER_00: Colleagues, I introduced this resolution last week in the wake of a number of recent anti-Semitic incidents locally and nationally.
(1:55:46) SPEAKER_00: Here in San Francisco, we've seen the repeated targeting and harassment of prominent Jewish individuals, businesses, and institutions.
(1:55:52) SPEAKER_00: We've seen bullying and even violent assaults on Jews of no particular prominence at all.
(1:55:57) SPEAKER_00: In the United States, at different times in our history, it has been easy for American Jews to imagine that anti-Semitism is not a thing here.
(1:56:04) SPEAKER_00: I certainly believe that growing up in San Francisco.
(1:56:07) SPEAKER_00: My grandmother had come to the United States in the 50s, bringing my father across the Atlantic on a boat, two survivors of a continent gone mad.
(1:56:15) SPEAKER_00: She had seen anti-Jewish hate up close and had lost most of her family to it.
(1:56:19) SPEAKER_00: But that was Europe in a different time.
(1:56:21) SPEAKER_00: That kind of thing just couldn't happen in this country.
(1:56:25) SPEAKER_00: The Irish writer Conor Cruz O'Brien described anti-Semitism as a light sleeper.
(1:56:30) SPEAKER_00: That observation seems particularly relevant to the current moment in this country where hatreds of all kinds are rousing on the right and the left.
(1:56:37) SPEAKER_00: The United States in 2025 is, of course, not Europe in 1933, but ancient bigotries do seem to find a way to adapt themselves to changing times.
(1:56:45) SPEAKER_00: And Jews do know from our history that those hatreds left unchecked can do unimaginable harm.
(1:56:50) SPEAKER_00: So, colleagues, I believe at the very least this is a moment for our Board of Supervisors to speak up about this particular form of hatred to condemn it and recommit ourselves to ensuring that San Francisco continues to be a welcoming city for Jews and for all people.
(1:57:03) SPEAKER_00: I want to thank you for your unanimous co-sponsorship.
(1:57:05) SPEAKER_00: I want to thank JCRC and I want to thank especially Supervisor Melgar for your input on language.
(1:57:10) SPEAKER_00: And I want to thank Melanie Matthewson in my office for all of her work on this.
(1:57:16) SPEAKER_00: And I think we can take that item, same house, same call without objection.
(1:57:21) SPEAKER_00: The resolution is adopted.
(1:57:25) SPEAKER_00: And Madam Clerk, do we have any imperative agenda items?
(1:57:32) SPEAKER_01: They're an entry report, Mr. President.
(1:57:34) SPEAKER_00: Then could you read the memoriams?
(1:57:36) SPEAKER_01: Yes, today's meeting will be adjourned in memory of the following beloved individual on behalf of Supervisor Walton for the late Ayesha Antijohn-Ina.
(1:57:49) SPEAKER_00: I think that brings us to the end of our agenda.
(1:57:51) SPEAKER_00: Madam Clerk, is there any further business before us today?
(1:57:53) SPEAKER_01: That concludes our business for today.
(1:57:55) SPEAKER_00: Then we are adjourned.","A resolution was introduced and adopted by the Board of Supervisors to condemn recent anti-Semitic incidents both locally and nationally, reaffirming San Francisco's commitment to being an inclusive and safe city that opposes all forms of hate, including religion-based discrimination. The resolution acknowledged the historical context of anti-Semitism and emphasized the importance of speaking out against such hatred. The board also recognized the contributions of various individuals and organizations in drafting the resolution. Following the adoption, memoriams were read, and the meeting was adjourned.",{}
