# Transcript Processing Pipeline

A modular Python-based pipeline for scraping video content, transcribing audio, summarizing speech, and merging outputs into CSVs.

Main Technologies: WhisperX, pyannote, Cerebras, CUDA

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Python dependencies (May include unnecrssary dependencies)
â”œâ”€â”€ webscrape.py             # Scrapes agenda, timestamp, and metadata from web pages
â”œâ”€â”€ transcribe.py            # Transcribes a single audio file
â”œâ”€â”€ transcribe_csv.py        # Transcribes an audio file with segments according to the agenda
â”œâ”€â”€ summarize.py             # Summarizes transcriptions using a language model
â”œâ”€â”€ merge_csvs.py            # Merges transcript and summary CSVs
```

## ðŸ›  Tips

- Use GPU (CUDA) for faster transcription and summarization.
- Make sure youâ€™re not exceeding API rate limits for online models.
- Ensure proper installation of system dependencies for Whisper, pyannote, and etc.(like `ffmpeg`).
